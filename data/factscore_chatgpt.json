Senecio became consul ordinarius in 99. During the Dacian Wars, he held the governorship of Moesia Inferior.

Pliny the Younger addressed two letters to a \"Senecio\" who is commonly identified with him. The first, beginning with \"This year has produced a healthy crop of poets####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\", is on the health of contemporary Roman literature. The second is a request for a commission as military tribune on behalf of a relative of Pliny's friend Gaius Calvisius Rufus. Plutarch also dedicated several of his \"Parallel Lives\" (\"Theseus\" 1, \"Demosthenes\" 1, \"Brutus\" 1) as well some of the individual \"Moralia\" (\"Quaestiones conviviales\" and \"Quomodo quis suos in virtute sentiat profectus\") to Senecio. These include reminiscences about Plutarch's and Senecio's conversations at Athens, Patras and Rome, as well as at Plutarch's home in Boeotia, where Senecio attended the wedding of Plutarch's son. Senecio married the daughter of Sextus Julius Frontinus, a three-time consul (cos. 97, 98, 100).

He has worked as translator and professor of French in Cuba and in Ecuador. He has translated into Spanish the works of Roland Barthes, Gilles Deleuze, Antonin Artaud, Emil Cioran and Denis Roche, among others authors. In 1990, with 19 years, he won the poetry prize Luis Rogel####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####io Nogueras in Havana with his first book \"El llanto del escriba\", published two years afterwards. It was followed by \"Relicarios\" (1994) and \"Las palabras pedestres\" (1996). The latter won the David prize of poetry of the previous year. Fernandez Fe wrote his first novella, \"La Falacia\", in 1996. \u201cA work of deep anxiety and odd maturity\u2026 (\u2026)\", according to the Cuban writer and Leonardo Padura.\"It is an indisputable sign that a new narrator has born in Cuba (\u2026).\u201d. The novella received an honorable mention in the Contest Italo Calvino, of which Padura was one of the jurors. The book of essay \"Cuerpo a diario\" (2007) is a curious panorama on diaries written in extreme situations like war, illness or living in totalitarian states. In the 2011 he published \"El \u00faltimo d\u00eda del estornino\". For the critic Jeff Lawrence, this book marks \"the insertion of Fern\u00e1ndez Fe in an important current of contemporary Latin American writers like Ricardo Piglia, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, and Juan Villoro\". Rafael Rojas thinks that in this novel there####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### is \"a multiple invention of writing, text, authorship and reader, trying to destabilize the poetic traditions of the Cuban literature of the last half century\" Fernandez Fe lives in the United States since 2013. Of his book \"Notas al total\", published in 2015, the Cuban critic Gilberto Padilla C\u00e1rdenas has said: \"\"Notas al total\" was probably the best book published by a Cuban writer in the year 2015. GFF Is in the Hall of the Fame of the Cuban essay (...) While the others age, GFF rejuvenates with a literature (...) that reads like a battle of other genres -journalism, history, testimony, etc.- against the nirvana of the traditional forms.\" In the prologue of \"Hotel Singapur\" (2021), Cuban novelist Abilio Est\u00e9vez says that the novel \"highlights what \"La Falacia\" and \"El \u00faltimo d\u00eda del estornino\" seemed to make quite clear: Gerardo Fern\u00e1ndez Fe is already one of the essential Cuban writers born after 1959\".

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Zamfir Arbore Zamfir Constantin Arbore (; born Zamfir Ralli,, \"Zemfiriyi Konstantinovich Arborye-Ralli\"; also known as Zamfir Arbure, Zamfir Rally, Zemphiri Ralli and Aivaza; November 14, 1848 \u2013 April 2 or April 3, 1933) was a Bukovinian-born Romanian political activist originally active in the Russian Empire, also known for his work as an amateur historian, geographer and ethnographer. Arbore debuted in left-wing politics from early in life, gained an intimate knowledge of the Russian revolutionary milieu, and participated in both nihilist and Narodnik conspiracies. Self-exiled to Switzerland, he became a member of the International Workingmen's Association. Arbore was mostly active as an international anarchist and a disciple of Mikhail Bakunin, but eventually parted with the latter to create his independent group, the Revolutionary Community. He was subsequently close to the anarchist geographer \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus, who became his new mentor. Arbore settled in Romania after 1877, and, abandoning anarchism altogether, committed himself to the more moderate cause of socialism. His####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### campaign against Russian despotism also led him to champion the cause of freedom for Bessarabia region, to which he was personally tied by his family history. These commitments resulted in Arbore's outside support for the Russian Revolution of 1905, when he and Petru Cazacu founded the Swiss-based \"Basarabia\" newspaper. Arbore had by then earned academic credentials with his detailed works on Bessarabian geography, and, as a cultural journalist, cultivated relationships with socialist and National Liberal activists. He was also notoriously the friend of poet Mihai Eminescu in the 1880s, and worked closely with writer Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu during the 1890s. During World War I, Zamfir Arbore provoked controversy when he supported a Romanian alliance with the Central Powers, justified in his opinion by a need to liberate Bessarabia. Despite this, and although he publicly welcomed the October Revolution, Arbore was reintegrated into the political scene of Greater Romania, serving two terms in Senate. Before his death in 1933, he was drawn into agrarian and cooperativist politics, and was successively a member of the Peasants' Party and the People's####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Party. Arbore was survived by his two daughters, both of them famous in their own right: Ecaterina was a communist politician and physician; Nina a modern artist.</s><s>Biography.</s><s>Biography.:Origins and early life. Zamfir Ralli was the scion of boyar aristocracy from the principality of Moldavia: his paternal grandfather Zamfirache Ralli was an ennobled Greek merchant, married into the local Romanian elite; Zamfir's mother was an ethnic Ukrainian. Although cosmopolitan, the future activist always prioritized his Romanian roots, changing his birth name to \"Arbore\" (var. \"Arbure\") in the belief that his Romanian ancestors had inherited the name and boyar status from the ancient Arbore family. Zamfirache's son Constantin, the friend of poet Alexander Pushkin, was reputedly adopted by Dimitrie Arbore. He also inherited a Bessarabian manorial estate in Dolna, which in the 1820s had served as the Pushkin's vacation house. The subsequent genealogical claim traced the family history back to the late 15th century, with \"Hetman\" Luca Arbore. It also made####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Zamfir a distant relative of various members of Romanian socialist environment, including Vasile Mor\u021bun and Izabela Sadoveanu. The claim's reliability divides modern researchers. While historian of journalism Victor Frunz\u0103 sees Arbore as descending \"from an ancient family of local boyars\", academic Lucian Boia describes Zamfir Arbore as being tied to the historical Arbores by \"a rather thin line\". Boia also notes that Arbore's \"revised past\" and arbitrary interpretation of his own background may have been opportunistic, leaving Arbore free to gravitate between conflicting national identities and rendering his radical discourse more palatable for all cultural contexts. According to political scientist Armand Go\u0219u, Arbore had effectively \"stolen\" his grandmother's maiden name, reviving an otherwise extinct boyar line. Although mostly active in Bessarabia, Arbore was actually a native of Chernowitz (), the administrative center of Bukovina within the Austrian Empire (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine). He later moved into Bessarabia (the Russian-ruled Bessarabian Governorate), attending school in Kishinev (Chi\u0219in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\u0103u), before moving to another school in Nikolayev. During his troubled youth, Arbore-Ralli underwent medical training in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but was more involved within the revolutionary, nihilist and pan-Russian anarchist underground, with the goal of subverting Tsarist autocracy. His political sympathies also connected him with the Narodnik movement, which he joined at the same time as other young Bessarabian intellectuals (Victor Cr\u0103sescu, Axinte Frunz\u0103, Constantin Stere, Nicolae Zubcu-Codreanu) who saw a link between their nationalist struggle and the agrarian cause of Russian Narodniks (he is believed to have been personally acquainted with the agrarian theorist and Narodnik father figure Alexander Herzen).</s><s>Biography.:In Switzerland. The subversive activities brought Zamfir to the attention of Tsarist authorities, particularly after his involvement in Sergey Nechayev's nihilist conspiracy of 1869. Unable to finish his studies, Arbore was singled out for arrest, and according to his own account, since placed under doubt, even served time as a political prisoner in the Peter and Paul Fortress and in Siberia. Eventually,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### he made his way to Switzerland, where he contacted international anarchist figures such as Mikhail Bakunin and \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus. Arbore corresponded with the latter for a significant period, sharing his interest in social geography. His complex relationship with radical exiles also resulted in contacts with anarcho-communist theorist Peter Kropotkin and the Bulgarian anarchist sympathizer Hristo Botev. He was also, with philosopher Vasile Conta, one of the few intellectuals with a Romanian background to affiliate directly with the International Workingmen's Association (First International), which regrouped the various Marxist and anarchist communities of Europe. In tandem, Arbore was active within Bakunin's Revolutionary Brotherhood, and, according to anarchist historian George Woodcock, one of the \"most influential\" among the Russian propagators of Bakuninism; political historian James H. Billington also refers to \"Zemfiry Ralli\" as \"Bakunin's principal editor\". Arbore's beliefs led him to join the Jura federation, an anarchist cell within the First International, and to become initiated into Freemasonry (1872). He became strongly opposed to Bakunin's marginalization during the First International's Hague Congress, and signed his name (\"Z. R####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####alli\") to a letter of protest, alongside Nikolay Ogarev. Also in 1872, Arbore also helped draft the German-language pamphlet which documented Bakunin's condemnation of Nechayev: \"Ist Netshaejeff ein politischer Verbrecher oder nicht?\" (\"Is Nechayev a Political Felon, or Is He Not?\"). With Bakunin and Errico Malatesta, he was personally involved in the anarchist agitation sweeping Restoration Spain during the 1870s: he personally helped translate Bakunin's letter to the Iberian anarchists, but their hopes of inciting a new revolution were unsuccessful; progressively after that moment, Arbore and Bakunin grew estranged from one another. According to Woodcock, the reason behind this \"personal\" rather than ideological conflict was Bakunin's \"tactless\" support for Arbore's adversary Mikhail Sanzhin, leading Arbore and his partners, the \"young Bakuninists\", to establish the Revolutionary Community organization. The reasons and objectives of this group, whose other members were Vladimir Holstein, Alexander Oelsnitz and Nikolai Ivanovich Zhukovsky, were outlined in a letter to Jura anarchist James Guillaume. Moving from Zurich####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to Geneva, and known primarily as \"Ralli\", Arbore ran a socialist publishing house, through which he helped popularize the political manifestos of anarchism, as well as his own history of the Paris Commune. He was among those who established, in 1875, the Genevan Russian-language newspaper \"Rabotnik\" (\"The Worker\"), which bridged the \"young Bakuninist\" faction with the Eser Party of Vera Figner and Reclus' St. Imier International. One of his colleagues there, future astronomer Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov, recalled that Arbore was actively involved in redacting news arriving from Russia, manipulating them for dramatic effect and political conformity. In 1875, he also wrote and published the anarchist tract \"Sytye i golodnye\" (\"The Sated and the Hungry\"), as well as an appeal to Ukrainian peasants in the Russian Empire. The Swiss period was the start of his new family life. Arbore was by then married, to the Russian Ecaterina Hardina. The dowry she brought helped maintain his new publishing venture. His eldest child was daughter Ecaterina Arbore-Ralli, the future communist, feminist and militant physician, born on####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### November 11, 1873, at Bex. His son Dumitru (Mitic\u0103) was born on January 11, 1877, in Geneva.</s><s>Biography.:Relocation to Romania. Zamfir Arbore first set foot in Romania during 1873, when he traveled from Geneva to Ia\u0219i, meeting with the young socialist sympathizer Eugen Lupu. He was later in contact with the Ia\u0219i Marxist circle of Ioan, Iosif and Sofia N\u0103dejde, sending them books by Karl Marx and his anarchist commentators (Johann Most, Carlo Cafiero). Arbore also established contacts with the socialist cell of Bucharest. He corresponded with some of the Russian socialists who had set up camp there, primarily so with Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Nicolae Zubcu-Codreanu. Together, they set up the Society for Student Culture and Solidarity, a semi-clandestine club located at the Concordia Hotel. Again in Switzerland, he took part in the violent Red Flag Riot of Berne, organized in 1877 by the anarchist dissidence of the International\u2014allegedly, his life was saved by fellow anarchist Jacques Gross####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. In 1878, Arbore was also the editor of the international tribune of the Revolutionary Community, \"Obshchina\" (\"Community\"), which was published as a successor of \"Rabotnik\". Reputedly threatened with an extradition back into the Russian Empire, Zamfir Arbore moved to Romania after the beginning of a Russo-Turkish War, during which the country, a Russian ally, obtained her independence from the Ottoman Empire. He later recalled that the inspiration for this move was young Romanian leftist Mircea Rosetti, whom he had first met during Reclus' visit to Vevey. Arbore's original goal was the spread of revolutionary propaganda among soldiers in the Imperial Russian Army, but, in short time, he settled down in Bucharest. It was there that Arbore fathered a second daughter, Lolica, who died without reaching maturity. Arbore later set up, with fellow exiles Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Zubcu-Codreanu, Pavel Axelrod and Nikolai Sudzilovsky (Russel), an underground political movement agitating for the cause of Bessarabian Romanians; by means of this group, he is said to have gained access within the governing####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### National Liberal Party, even earning discreet support from two of its leading figures, Ion Br\u0103tianu and C. A. Rosetti (father of Mircea Rosetti). Arbore would later speak of Br\u0103tianu as a discreet supporter of his projects to undermine Russian governments. Additionally, C. A. Rosetti is alleged to have personally assisted Arbore and Zubcu-Codreanu, who shared a Bucharest apartment, from evading both the persistent scrutiny of Romanian Police forces and the threat of extradition. In May 1877, Police forces quashed the Concordia hotel club, arresting various of its members. Arbore's connections were unsuccessful when it came to rescuing Dobrogeanu-Gherea, kidnapped and deported by the Russian Army in autumn 1877, although he eventually helped track down Gherea in Russia. Three years later, when Dobrogeanu-Gherea escaped back to Romania, Arbore helped him set up a restaurant in Ploie\u0219ti station, from which Gherea supported his family. Another National Liberal figure, the Bessarabian historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, also cultivated a friendship with Arbore. According to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Arbore's own recollections, although he and Hasdeu had been separated by \"political-social views\", they had been brought together by the recent deaths of Iulia Hasdeu and Lolica Arbore. Their shared loss, Arbore recalled, was leading them both to seek intellectual comfort in spiritualism or spiritism: Arbore, who was in correspondence with spiritists Camille Flammarion and William Crookes, recalled having joined a secretive spiritualist circle formed in Hasdeu's home, and being ridiculed in the Romanian press over this issue. Hasdeu was one of the noted guests in Arbore's own house.</s><s>Biography.:1880s politics. After the Trial of the Fourteen, the Revolutionary Community and all other Bakuninist groups were losing the battle in front of renewed Tsarist repression. Arbore, who now criticized Bakunian anarchism, quickly came to the conclusion that a socialist party was needed as a more radical alternative to the Romanian two-party system: in 1879, he helped organize the first-ever conference of Romanian socialist clubs, and, over the following months, was member of the editorial staff at \"Rom\u00e2nia Viitoare\", the socialist review (as a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### result of his participation, the magazine also enlisted contributions from Reclus and his brother \u00c9lie, as well as from poet Louis-Xavier de Ricard). The next year, he and the N\u0103dejdes were briefly in contact with the senior political radical Titus Dunka, distributing for a while Dunka's gazette \"\u00cenainte!\" (\"Forward!\"). In 1880, after a failed attempt on Ion Br\u0103tianu's life, the socialist circles faced government suspicion and became less organized, a situation which lasted until the election of 1888. At the time, Arbore was editor of Rosetti's democratic gazette \"Rom\u00e2nul\", and later moved to a similar position with the left-leaning newspaper \"Telegraful Rom\u00e2n\". Also at that stage, he befriended the Bukovinian Mihai Eminescu, later recognized as Romania's national poet, but at the time a secondary figure in the Bucharest press. Eminescu, who worked for the Conservative Party tribune \"Timpul\", confided in Arbore about his pessimistic vision of Romanian society. At this stage, Arbore is believed to have helped other foreign-born socialists to find refuge in Romania####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####: in particular to have assisted Peter (Petru) Alexandrov, the brother-in-law of writer Vladimir Korolenko, in obtaining a license to practice medicine in Tulcea and in defending himself during subsequent police inquiries. In 1881, he was himself naturalized a citizen of the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania. By summer 1883, when Arbore too lost National Liberal support and was briefly expelled from Romania, Eminescu had become afflicted with mental illness (he eventually died in relative isolation, in 1889). Arbore was, around 1890, a correspondent for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dam\u00e9's Bucharest newspaper \"La Libert\u00e9 Roumaine\", with expos\u00e9 pieces on the kidnapping of junior Bulgarian Navy officer Vladimir Kisimov by Russian spies. His third daughter Nina, later known as a visual artist, was born in January 1888. The elder, Ecaterina, was already taking her first steps in socialist politics, as a delegate to the International Congress of Students, held in Giurgiu. Meanwhile, Zamfir Arbore was progressively integrated into the Romanian civil service: a clerk at the State Archives, he became a statistician in service to the Bucharest City Hall (from 1896 to 1920). As a socialist activist####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, he was coming to support the faction of Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Constantin Mille, who published \"Lumea Nou\u0103\" review and ultimately set up the short-lived Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR).</s><s>Biography.:\"Amicul Copiilor\" and scientific work. From 1891 to 1898, he and Victor Cr\u0103sescu (who signed with the pen name \"\u0218tefan Basarabescu\") were founders and managers of \"Amicul Copiilor\" (\"The Children's Friend\") magazine, which circulated classic works of children's literature and is sometimes rated as the first comic book magazine in Romanian history. Hasdeu, one of its main writers, is occasionally given credit as the person behind \"Amicul Copiilor\". Arbore himself experimented with the genre, publishing children's versions of \"Don Quixote\", \"Tartarin of Tarascon\" and \"Robinson Crusoe\", as well as popular histories\u2014one about Ancient Egypt, the other about 1821 rebel Tudor Vladimirescu. Hasdeu co-opted Arbore for the early 1899 project to create a professional association of writers as####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### part of his Press Society (an actual Romanian Writers' Society was only created some 10 years later, after Hasdeu's death). As statistician, Arbore was in charge of Bucharest's \"Buletinul Statistic\" (\"Statistical Bulletin\") and of the City Hall Library, which under his direction acquired several thousands of new books. With Ioan N\u0103dejde, Arbore translated into Romanian the Russian Commercial Code. In parallel, he completed his main and lengthiest study in ethnography, \"Basarabia \u00een secolul XIX\" (\"Bessarabia in the 19th Century\"), first published in 1898. It earned its author the annual Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu Prize of the Romanian Academy. Beginning 1903, he also taught Russian at the Bucharest War School. Arbore followed up on his scholarly work with the 1904 \"Dic\u021bionar geografic al Basarabiei\" (\"A Geographical Dictionary of Bessarabia\"). The same year, he was a voluntary contributor, with Bessarabian-themed entries, to the first-ever Romanian encyclopedic dictionary: \"Enciclopedia####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### rom\u00e2n\u0103\", published in Austria-Hungary by Cornelius Diaconovich and ASTRA cultural society. In 1906, during the National Exhibit held in celebration of the Romanian Kingdom (and one year before the large-scale peasants' revolt), Arbore joined a scientific committee which supervised an academic inquiry into the state of Romanian peasants, whose main author was militant sociologist G. D. Scraba.</s><s>Biography.:1905 Revolution. Before and during the Russian Revolution of 1905, Arbore was also involved in trafficking subversive works of literature over the Romanian\u2013Russian border, hoping to encourage a rebellion among Bessarabian Romanian peasants and intellectuals. Theodor Incule\u021b, a theologian and political agitator, was one of his connections there. As Incule\u021b later wrote, the books \"sent over by Arbure\" were unequivocally \"anti-Russian\". In 1904, Mikhail Nikolayevich von Giers, the Russian Ambassador to Romania, warned National Liberal Premier Dimitrie Sturdza that \"Mr. Ralli-Arbore\" intended to send into Russia many small packages of brochures, to be delivered by a special network of socialist agents. This exchange of notes degenerated into a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### major diplomatic incident when some of the contraband books were confiscated by Russian officials, and discovered to contain firearms. Arbore was singled out for extradition, but saved through the intercession of Take Ionescu, the Interior Minister, who even managed to have the weapons dispatched back to Romania. This was the beginning of an unusually close relationship with Romania's conservative environment and King Carol I (to whom he dedicated a volume of his memoirs). Reportedly as a favor to the Bessarabian activist, Carol was to allow safe passage into Romania to the wanted Russian Eser assassin Boris Savinkov. According to Arbore's own account, Carol, \"the founder of modern Romania\", privately resented Russia's national policy on Bessarabia. Zamfir Arbore also welcomed into his house the \"Potemkin\" mutiny refugees\u2014including socialist sailor Afanasi Matushenko, who became his close friend. He registered another personal triumph in 1905, when his aging friend Reclus also traveled to Romania. However, his main interest was by then outside the realm of socialist or anarchist politics. Together with Petru Cazacu, Arbore founded and edited a newspaper named \"Basarabia\", printed in Switzerland but####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### clandestinely circulated the Russian Empire during the Revolution. \"Basarabia\" went out of print after six consecutive issues, and, throughout its existence advertised itself as a Chi\u0219in\u0103u-based paper (although its editorial office was located in Geneva). An immediate predecessor for the legal \"Basarabia\" of 1906, it was noted for its radical support of Bessarabian autonomy, demands for universal suffrage, and adoption of a modern Romanian alphabet instead of traditional Moldavian Cyrillic letters. In its final issue, Arbore and Cazan's gazette published the program of an incipient National Moldavian Party. After the Revolution toned down repression, Arbore could also collaborate with the Saint Petersburg-based socialist magazine \"Byloye\", which published his biographical sketch of Sergey Nechayev. The text, signed \"Zemfir Ralli Arbore\", notably includes detail on Nechayev's isolated political outlook, which, Arbore argued, was linked directly to 18th century Jacobin theorists and agitators (Maximilien de Robespierre, Philippe Buonarroti) rather than to later socialist schools.</s><s>Biography.:\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####Milcovul\" Society and PSDR connections. By 1908, Arbore had founded another venue for pro-Bessarabian political activism, the \"Milcovul\" Society (named after the Milcov River, a symbol of Romanian unity). The association was soon after infiltrated by the Russian spy Gheorghe V. Madan: exposed through a public scandal, Madan was expelled from \"Milcovul\" by Arbore's own vote. The controversy drew attention from Romania's secret service, \"Siguran\u021ba Statului\", whose agents suspected, probably without just cause, that Arbore maintained contacts with Madan over the following period. In June 1909, Constantin Mille's daily, \"Adev\u0103rul\", printed a draft of Arbore's memoirs, dealing with Eminescu's political views. During the same years, Arbore played host to a new generation of Romanian socialist leaders and leaders of the local labor movement, who attempted to recreate a socialist party from the defunct PSDMR: Christian Rakovsky, Gheorghe Cristescu, I. C. Frimu and N. D. Cocea. Arbore did not join the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), created by Rakovsky in 1910, but was a special guest at its reunions. He was thus present at the PSDR's 1912 rally at \"Sala Dacia\", where, in agreement with Rakovsky's political tenets, he spoke about the need to contain Russian imperialism; on the centenary of Bessarabia's occupation, he also addressed Romanian student organizations, informing them about the state of affairs in Russian dominions. Arbore was also claiming that some violent anarchists were in fact Russian agents: according to him, the suspected terrorist Ilie C\u0103t\u0103r\u0103u was a secret affiliate of the loyalist Black Hundreds. In September 1914, Arbore was honored by the PSDR's festive assembly honoring the 50th anniversary of the First International. In parallel, he gave external support to unionizing efforts, being notably an honored guest at the Romanian Journalists' Union festivities of May 1912, where he mainly spoke about Bessarabia. His first-born daughter, who had by then made her first contributions to social medicine, became directly involved with the PSDR and the \"Rom\u00e2nia Muncitoare\" club, and, also in 1912, was elected to the PS####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####DR Executive Committee. Dumitru, who was a chemical engineer in the thriving oil industry, and Nina, a debuting painter, were also both affiliated with PSDR at a grassroots level. During that interval, the Bessarabian scholar was also becoming interested in cultivating a rapprochement between Romania and the Kingdom of Bulgaria, Romania's new neighbor to the south. This was reflected in his set of contributions to Slavistics and philology. His Romanian-Bulgarian dictionary, \"\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043e-\u0440\u0443\u043c\u044a\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\", saw print in 1909. In 1912, Arbore translated and published for \"Minerva\" newspaper the 1886 manifesto \"To the Romanian People\", signed by Bulgarian revolutionary Zahari Stoyanov, in which Stoyanov spoke about his country's \"moral duty\" toward Romania and deplored the slow descent into ethnic rivalry.</s><s>Biography.:World War I controversies. Arbore's activity as a publicist, activist and newspaperman flared up during the early stages of World War I, as Romania hesitated between joining the Entente Powers or honoring its loose commitment to the Central Powers, and in particular the German####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Empire. Like other Bessarabian exiles, Arbore objected to the first option, since it threw Romania into the same camp as the Russian Empire, opening the way for Russian domination in Romania, while leaving Bessarabia oppressed and Russified; he also identified the Ententist preoccupation with the Romanians of Transylvania and Bukovina as excessive, claiming that Austria-Hungary would inevitably transform itself into a democratic federation upon the end of war. These ideas made their way into his wartime articles for \"Seara\" newspaper and his standalone political essays: the 1914 \"Autonomia sau anexarea. Transilvania \u0219i Bucovina\" (\"Autonomy or Annexation. Transylvania and Bukovina\"), the 1915 \"Liberarea Basarabiei\" (\"The Liberation of Bessarabia\") and the 1916 \"Ukraina \u0219i Rom\u00e2nia\" (\"Ukraine and Romania\"). Of these, \"Liberarea Basarabiei\" was printed with support from an eponymous political society, the League for the Liberation of Bessarabia. Arbore's stance was compatible with the PSDR's Zimmerwald neutralism:####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### by 1915, Ecaterina Arbore was also noted for her political statements against a Russian alliance. Internationally, her father collaborated with \"Annales des Nationalit\u00e9s\", the anti-imperialist periodical put out by Jean P\u00e9lissier and Juozas Gabrys. Suspicion arose that Arbore was also in the pay of German intelligence, receiving at least 28,000 lei through such channels. In summer 1916, Romania disappointed Arbore by rallying with the Entente. After a short-lived offensive into Transylvania, the Romanian Land Forces were defeated, and the Central Powers invaded southern Romania. Arbore stayed behind in German-occupied Bucharest while the legitimate government withdrew to Ia\u0219i, and maintained a generally friendly but discreet attitude toward the occupiers. He was less active as a journalist and militant, but contributed to the Germanophile daily \"Lumina\", put out by the Bessarabian activist Constantin Stere, and once lectured on the Bessarabian question during April 1918. Arbore also kept a low profile during the 1918 truce, when, with German acquiescence, Romania united with Bessarabia. Reputedly, Stere,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### who negotiated the union with the Bessarabian Assembly, mistrusted and sidelined Arbore during the events. In his own account of the wartime years, Arbore claimed to have been arrested on several occasions by the occupation authorities, but this claim, Boia notes, remains unverified and doubtful. Arbore was returning to a socialist discourse, probably rekindled and reshaped by news of the October Revolution in Russia. During the period, he took a personal interest in the fate of Russian prisoners held on occupied territory, and, in a letter to the Germanophile academic Ioan Bianu, spoke about the need to popularize revolutionary ideas among this particular group.</s><s>Biography.:Senator and political suspect. After the unexpected German defeat of November 1918 brought a moral victory for Romanian Ententists and the return of Ententist forces in government, Arbore withstood scrutiny as an alleged collaborator with the enemy. In this context, he rallied with a new radical force, the Peasants' Party, and ran for political office in what was by then Greater Romania. During the November 1919 election, he presented himself as a Senate candidate for Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia, and was elected. His####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### new political credo was outlined in his Senate speech of December 27, 1918, which focused on proposals to change the 1866 constitutional regime and amend the prewar tradition of centralized government, while also outlining his main defense against suspicions of collaborationism. His daughter Ecaterina was rendered a suspect by her Socialist Party of Romania militancy. She further antagonized the public when, as a Communist Party of Romania founder, she supported the self-determination of Bessarabia and its separation from Romania, in line with Comintern policies. After being arrested several times, she made her may into the Soviet state. Dumitru Arbore also joined the Communist Party, was kept under surveillance by the authorities for hosting conspirative sessions at his home in Prahova County, but remained in Romania, where he died in an October 1921 accident. Arbore lost his Senate seat when Parliament was dissolved by King Ferdinand I; he soon after left the Peasants' Party, pushed into opposition, and was reelected to the Senate as a People's Party candidate in the summer 1920 election. Late in 1920, he was co-founder and secretary of the Socialist Peasants' Party, together with playwright Ion Peretz, publicist Ioan Pangal,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### abbot Iuliu Scriban etc. Withdrawn from national politics, Arbore again focused on his journalist's activity and was at the forefront of Romanian Freemasonry. His membership in the local subsidiary of the \"Grand Orient de France\" was confirmed in December 1922 by Mihail Noradunghian, and he was recognized as a Rank 33 Mason, Worshipful Master of Human Rights Lodge (located in Bucharest). On April 23, 1923, Arbore was elected Grand Master of a major Romanian Scottish Rite branch, the Grand Lodge (Grand Master for life after 1930), and was the Grand Orator for Romania within the Supreme Scottish Rite Council from 1929. These promotions were scrutinized by the anti-Masonic far right: in a public conference, Nicolae Paulescu of the National-Christian Defense League called Arbore the Grand Master of a \"Kike-Romanian Masonic group\". His own far left inclinations were by then contrasting with his civil service positions, which he maintained even as his daughter Ecaterina was becoming a \"persona non grata\". In 1923, Arbore published a new installment of his memoirs, as \"\u00cen temni\u021bele ruse\u0219ti\" (\"In####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Russian Dungeons\"). In March 1924, he replaced Vasile Ghenzul as editorial director of \"Furnica\" (\"The Ant\"). The cooperativist and agrarian bimonthly was published in Bessarabia, and printed a Russian-language supplement. He was still a contributor to the central leftist press: in December 1926, \"Adev\u0103rul\" published his piece about the Serbian politician Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, defunct leader of the People's Radical Party. During this interval, Ecaterina tried to return to Romania. According to the opinion of journalist Victor Frunz\u0103, she was trying to hide her growing disillusionment with communism under the pretext that she needed to take care of her ailing father. The Romanian authorities did not allow her entry into the country, and she was forced back. Zamfir and his wife had earlier adopted Dumitru's young child, Zamfir Dumitru Arbore.</s><s>Biography.:Final years. In 1930, the recently widowed Zamfir Arbore was pensioned from his teaching position at the Bucharest War School, where he had also been lecturing in Geography and Topography. During the final years of his life,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Arbore was a sporadic contributor to Pan Halippa's review \"Via\u021ba Basarabiei\". In tandem, his revolutionary past, in particular his early dealings with Hristo Botev, were also the subject of interviews with journalist Vasile Christu. His own output as a researcher included an undated monograph on his friend and ally Zubcu-Codreanu, who had died in 1878 (\"O pagin\u0103 din istoria socialismului rom\u00e2n\", \"A Page in the History of Romanian Socialism\"), as well as the collected memoirs: \"Temni\u021b\u0103 \u0219i exil\" (\"Prison and Exile\") and \"\u00cen exil. Amintirile mele\" (\"In Exile. My Memories\"). Zamfir Arbore died in Bucharest, on April 2 or April 3, 1933. He was buried at Sf\u00e2nta Vineri Cemetery, alongside Ecaterina, Dumitru, and Lolica Arbore. Paradoxically, his funeral ceremony comprised both the military honors owed to his position in the War School and revolutionary orations given in tribute by his socialist comrades. The socialist tribune \"Societatea de####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### M\u00e2ine\" published an obituary, which referred to Arbore as \"one of the highest profile representative figures [in socialism], and one of the most worthy examples for all people-loving generations to follow.\"</s><s>Political and scientific theories.</s><s>Political and scientific theories.:Arbore's political program. Despite official promotion, Zamfir Arbore had serious trouble integrating his views within the political landscape of 20th century Romania. Critic and political historian Ioan Stanomir writes that Arbore, \"the agent who precipitates revolution\", was \"an aristocrat animated by dramatic self-loathing\". His Narodnik ideals subsided with time: according to literary historian Leonid Cemortan, Arbore was \"totally defeated\" in his Narodnik activity, realized that it was an \"unattainable dream\", but was nonetheless unable to \"verify and correct\" his vision. Arbore, who never registered his membership with any Romanian socialist party or faction, was reportedly perplexed by the antisemitism prevalent in his adoptive country, including among the Romanian socialists and trade unionists. His transition from anarchism to a more moderate platform was also shown by his treatment of the Bessarabian issue####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. In 1905, his \"Basarabia\" newspaper tied together demands of social reform with political and cultural goals, endorsing the planned land reform and demanding the official use of Romanian (\"Moldavian\") in the administrative apparatus and the Bessarabian Orthodox Church. Its demand for self-governance around an enlarged \"Sfat\" (\"Assembly\") referred back to promises made upon the creation of a Bessarabian Governorate. The entire program, scholar Marcel Mitra\u0219c\u0103 notes, was one of the first manifestations of \"Bessarabian [Romanian] nationalism\", the prototype for an agenda later espoused by the National Moldavian Party. Political analysts Mihai Cernencu and Igor Bo\u021ban suggest that the political doctrine supported by \"Basarabia\" was at once an early instance of Bessarabian liberalism and a regional affiliation to the Constitutional Democratic Party, somewhat permeated by the doctrines of social democracy. More intimately, Arbore was contemplating the possibility of an independent Bessarabia, free from what he considered to be the excesses of Romanian nationalism. By the end of his life, he was publicizing his disappointment with the political environment of Greater Romania and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### explaining his return to socialism. In a \"Via\u021ba Basarabiei\" article, he claimed: \"Wherever I look around me I see only decay. The old and the young, the cultivated and the illiterate, all behave equally, not even asking themselves what the meaning of their life is in the general progress of humanity. Living inside Romanian society I for one was not able to merge into it. [...] I haven't had and I still don't have friends in Romania.\" His attitude, including claims that Bessarabia was being colonized by rapacious Romanians from other provinces, outraged the nationalist newspaperman Alexandru \"Ion Gorun\" Hodo\u0219, who wrote that Arbore was no longer sincerely interested in national unity, but rather displayed \"the need to detect, under any Romanian uniform, an assassin of Bessarabia's population.\" Arbore's main research on Bessarabian history and local geography fused scientific and political objectives. Allegedly inspired by the similar interests of \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus, \"Dic\u021bionar geografic al Basarabiei\" was the first-ever actual Bessarabian gazetteer. In his two####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### works on Bessarabia, Arbore sought to present a detailed account of economic and social geography. He notably inventoried the villages originally settled by free peasants (\"r\u0103ze\u0219i\"), accounting for 151 such localities in central Bessarabia and 4 in the Budjak. Overall, the politicized aspect of his contribution also had negative connotations. According to literary critic Bogdan Cre\u021bu (who builds on the conclusions of literary historian Leonte Ivanov), Arbore was also responsible for circulating a stereotyped image of the Russian Empire and its inhabitants. Before 1914, Arbore made accusatory claims about Russification and the Russian Orthodox Church expansion into Bessarabia: depicting the Russian Synod as a heretical, non-Orthodox, institution, he argued that church officials were burning Romanian books for heating.</s><s>Political and scientific theories.:Germanophilia and Russophobia. Arbore's wartime stance, in particular his conjectural support for the Central Powers, was likened by Lucian Boia to that of fellow Bessarabian Constantin Stere, with the exception that Arbore was more the political radical, opposed to Tsarist autocracy, than a nationalist or Russoph####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####obe. However, as early as 1912, Arbore was envisaging a general rising against Russia, also involving the Poles and the Finns. In \"Autonomia sau anexarea\", he claimed that \"damned Russia\" secretly wanted to lure Romania into her war with the Austro-Hungarian provinces inhabited by Romanians, and in exchange expand its own territory southwards, into the Danube Delta and Dobruja. Arbore therefore saw the Transylvanian union as a hopeless project; his consolation for Romanians, Transylvanian as well as Bukovinian, was in the federalization of Austria-Hungary. Later, he claimed that his beliefs on the Transylvanian issue were quite similar to the skeptical Habsburg loyalism of Transylvanian politicos, from Eugen Brote and Ioan Slavici to Aurel Popovici. The articles he contributed to \"Seara\" noted with surprise that the pro-Entente Francophiles were more interested in rescuing France than they were in the fate of Bessarabian Romanians. \"Liberarea Basarabiei\", Marcel Mitra\u0219c\u0103 argues, was one of the select few manifestations of Romanian national####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### sentiment to advocate Bessarabian emancipation at the peak of wartime agitation, alongside similar manifestos by Stere, Axinte Frunz\u0103, Dumitru C. Moruzi etc. Arbore's political theory was later expanded into a Germanophile manifesto: Arbore claimed that Romania's only option was to rally with \"Russia's enemies\" on the Eastern Front, limiting European Russia to the \"ethnographic\" borders of ancient Muscovy; the alternative, he warned, was that the \"musc\u0103lime\" (\"Moskals\") would in the long run annex Romania and all her irredenta. Again, he described the Romanian prospects of \"liberating Bessarabia\" as intrinsically linked with the German-sponsored emancipation of Congress Poland, the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Ukraine. In an August 1915 piece for \"Seara\", Arbore saluted the German people as the more \"enlightened\" combatant, who had accumulated a \"colossal vital energy\" and was therefore poised to emerge as the victor. With \"Ukraina \u0219i Rom\u00e2nia\", Zamfir Arbore spoke out against the opinions expressed by Romanian nationalist historian Nicolae####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Iorga, a leading figure in pro-Entente politics, who had denied the existence of a distinct Ukrainian identity. In fact, Arbore argued, the cultural separation between Ukrainians and Russians was both justified by history and opportune for the Romanian cause: since the Russian Empire could not hope to become a federation, and an independent Ukraine was therefore inevitable, \"the Ukrainian state would be a peaceful neighbor to Greater Romania.\" According to Lucian Boia, Arbore's public stances under the actual German occupation were surprisingly toned down. His one article for \"Lumina\" (November 1917) reviewed the Russian issue in quite different terms, prophesying that a multinational federation could be effected around the Russian Provisional Government. His 1918 public lectures on Bessarabia were focused on geographic and statistical information\u2014\"one would have expected more\", Boia notes. Arbore was more outspoken during the interwar period: his December 1918 speech demanded the guarantee of minority rights in Greater Romania, saluted the policies of Soviet Russia as a liberating force, and predicted a Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War. On the occasion, Arbore also demanded the release of Socialist Party activists held in Romanian custody, as well as the freeing of Transylvanian####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### collaborationist Slavici.</s><s>Legacy.</s><s>Legacy.:Impact in academia. As both a historical figure and a historian, Zamfir Arbore received mixed reviews from other academics. His \"Via\u021ba Basarabiei\" partner Pan Halippa noted that Arbore's historical but minor merit in opposing \"Russification\" was equivalent to that of other Bessarabian boyars and writers from various epochs: Stere, Alecu Donici, Alexandru H\u00e2jdeu, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Constantin Stamati. Although an ideological adversary of Arbore, Nicolae Iorga similarly referred to his Bessarabian colleague as a pioneer of Romanian Bessarabian activism. Sociologist Henri H. Stahl focused instead on Arbore's contributions as a scientist. Stahl discusses him and Stere, alongside theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Nicolae Zubcu-Codreanu, as one of the most important intellectuals in the group of ex-Narodniks who contributed to the left-wing school of social sciences in Romania. He notes that Arbore stood apart in this group for his anarchist ideals,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### uncommon in his adoptive Romania. Contrarily, historian Cyril E. Black assessed that, unlike Stere's post-Narodnik theory of \"Poporanism\", Arbore's influence in Romanian politics was \"negligible\". A more controversial aspect of Arbore's legacy is an enduring accusation of plagiarism: his works are alleged to have borrowed the research of various other authors, to whom Arbore did not give proper credit. As early as 1879, Dobrogeanu-Gherea circulated some of Arbore's reminiscences of revolutionary life, quoted as excerpts in his own essays. One of the earliest historiographic works to trace Arbore's lifelong socialist militancy was authored shortly before its subject died, in 1933. Authored by I. C. Atanasiu, it was titled \"Mi\u0219carea socialist\u0103\" (\"The Socialist Movement\"). The same year, an account of his activities in Geneva was published as part of Pavel Axelrod's book of memoirs. A monograph on Arbore's life and work was published in 1936 by social scientist Alexandru Siedel.</s><s>Legacy.:The Arbores and communist censorship. From her adoptive Soviet Union, Arb####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ore's older daughter Ecaterina cultivated her father's image: in 1931, she helped publish fragments of his memoirs on Mikhail Bakunin and Sergey Nechayev, translated into Russian and signed with the abridged name \"Z. K. Ralli\". Noted for her medical work and political standing, Ecaterina was nevertheless labeled an enemy of the Soviet people, arrested and killed during the Great Purge of the late 1930s. As an author, Zamfir Arbore was somewhat tolerated in the Soviet Union and its Moldavian SSR, created in 1940 by the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia. In the late 1940s, his name was included on a long list of authors officially banned by the Soviet censorship apparatus. However, in later years he was officially quoted and praised, one of the few exceptions to the rule which put limits on the popularization of Romanian literature (unlike Stere, whose work were still banned). In Romania, Arbore was survived by daughter Nina (d. 1942). Known as the Romanian student of Henri Matisse, she maintained an interest in moderate leftist causes, joining the group formed around \"Cuv\u00e2ntul Liber\" newspaper. Her nephew Zamfir Dumitru Arb####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ore fought against Nazi Germany in World War II, receiving \"Steaua Rom\u00e2niei\". In postwar Communist Romania, Zamfir Dumitru Arbore worked as a state planner, and established a family: his successors were still living at the family home in Bucharest in the early 1970s. The Arbores' patriarch was being rediscovered as a scholar, in particular after the 1960s liberalization (when Ecaterina was posthumously rehabilitated). Communist censorship however intervened in his various republished texts, cutting out all remarks which could seem Russophobic, keeping his political writings hidden from public view while allowing some exposure to his geography tracts. Among the anti-communist Romanian diaspora, genealogist Mihai Dim. Sturdza completed a more thorough account of Arbore's career, which covered the controversial aspects and was published in Sturdza's dictionary \"Familiile boiere\u0219ti din Moldova \u0219i \u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\" (\"Boyar Families of Wallachia and Moldavia\"). Armand Go\u0219u noted that the entry comprised \"the best pages ever written on Zamfir Arbore\", while Ioan Stanomir sees in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### it a real-life equivalent of Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"The Possessed\" and Joseph Conrad's \"Under Western Eyes\". During the 1960s, the exiled journalist Pamfil \u0218eicaru also included ample references to Arbore's anti-Russian texts in his own anti-communist propaganda works. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Arbore's name resurfaced in a nationalist conspiracy theory, which claims that Mihai Eminescu's descent into mental illness was staged by his more conservative political rivals. According to this interpretation, the involuntary commitment of Eminescu in summer 1883 was set to coincide with the expulsion of his friend Arbore.</s><s>Legacy.:In Moldova and abroad. Arbore's works were reprinted in Moldova, the independent post-Soviet republic comprising the bulk of historical Bessarabia. Moldovan literary historians Ion Varta and Tatiana Varta oversaw the 2001 reprint of \"Basarabia \u00een secolul XIX\"; the same year, Editura Funda\u021biei Culturale Rom\u00e2ne and Editura Museum co-edited his \"Dic\u021bionar geografic al Basarabiei\",####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### with Iurie Colesnic as caretaker. His name was assigned to streets in both Chi\u0219in\u0103u and Bucharest. His Dolna manor is preserved as a museum. Arbore's contribution also made an impact outside its immediate cultural context. His memoirs were reviewed early on by anarchist historian Max Nettlau, who called them inaccurate, without specifying to what extent. Later, the various writings of Arbore-Ralli were studied, translated and preserved by exile Marxists Boris Nicolaevsky and Egor E. Lazarev, and passed on to the Hoover Institution. Writing in 1994, American historian Keith Hitchins reviewed \"Basarabia \u00een secolul XIX\" as \"an old, in some ways classic\" and \"still useful\" Romanian study of the Bessarabian question. Arbore's 2009 biography at the anarchist Kate Sharpley Library focuses on his revolutionary career rather than his other commitments, claiming that the Romanian reviews of his nationalist policies, beginning with Nicolae Iorga's texts, are \"mystification\", and noting that his activities in Greater Romania \"remain to be investigated\".

Howard Taylor (25 November 1862 \u2013 15 August 1946), was a British pioneer Protestant Christian missionary to China, author, speaker and second son of James Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission, and Maria Jane Dyer.</s><s>Beginnings. Howard Taylor was three when his father founded the China Inland Mission. He was born in London during his parents\u2019 first furlough in England together. In 1866 at the age of four he was taken with his parents, 3 siblings and sixteen other missionaries to China aboard the Lammermuir (clipper) as part of the famous Lammermuir Party. During the 4-month long voyage the ship was nearly wrecked by 2 typhoons. His sister, Grace Dyer Taylor died of meningitis the first year. When he was six the family was nearly killed by a rioting mob during the Yangzhou riot in 1868. Finally in 1870 he was sent home with his surviving siblings with Emily Blatchley to live in London, separated from his parents. His mother died in China soon after they arrived home in 1870. Like his father, he enrolled in the Royal London Hospital medical college, completing his diploma in 1888. Hudson Taylor lived####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to see his son, Howard follow in his footsteps to become a medical missionary to China. He received Doctor of Medicine from London University and subsequently became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons as well as a Member of the Royal College of Physicians. He was an extremely capable student and received three high honors in his postgraduate studies. Howard Taylor always had a close relationship with his father. 1888 was a special year for both men. Hudson Taylor was on his first tour in North America sharing the missionary needs in China. Howard Taylor had taken three months leave to go along, having just ended his year of medical and surgical appointments. Howard Taylor showed a deep interest to go to China long term. Hearing his father speak at various meetings, particularly to young students, had a profound influence on Howard. On 15 October 1889, at a Missionary Convention organized by the Students Foreign Missionary Union more than 1500 students attended. Of these, 152 signed the pledge, \"it is my earnest hope, if God permit, to engage in foreign missionary work.\" The first name in the book of members reads, \" Taylor, F Howard, MD, MRCP, FRCS (England), the London Hospital.\" He later noted: On 3 November 1889 Howard Taylor, accompanying his father Hudson####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Taylor, arrived at Gothenburg, where they were met by Mr. Josef Holmgren, the Secretary of the Swedish Mission in China, who invited them over for special meetings to mobilize the Swedish Christians for China. He had arranged the whole of their tour and was their companion and interpreter throughout the trip. Twenty towns were visited, including Stockholm, Uppsala and Christiania, and 50-60,000 people were addressed, even Queen Sophia invited Mr. Taylor to a private audience in Stockholm. Hudson Taylor was already 57 at that time, and no longer enjoying the same vigor as his son. Yet his insistence on traveling third class and carrying his own suitcase continued to give the young soon-to-be missionary a model of servanthood. Howard Taylor departed for China on 23 January 1890 from England as a single man. He married Mary Geraldine Guinness on 24 April 1894, daughter of Rev. Henry Grattan Guinness, another CIM missionary who went to China two years earlier. He was sent to Henan and his leadership was displayed with the opening of the ministry in the province, including the significant medical work which continued into the next 30 years. Howard was the first missionary to visit Zhengzhou in Henan. As such, he was the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### only trained physician south of the Yellow River among 20 million Chinese. In the spring of 1895 a mission station was opened as the result of the medical work for the previous three years at the invitation of Yuan Shikai, a rising political figure who later became President of China. Yuan, from Henan himself, called Howard Taylor one day to attend to his mother, dying of cancer. In recognition of his service, Li Hongzhang presented Howard Taylor with an honorific tablet. Howard spoke with strong convictions about what he believed to be his calling: In 1894 he married Mary Geraldine Guinness, a childhood friend from his youth in Bromley-by-Bow in the East End of London. Her father was Henry Grattan Guinness, the famous evangelist and preacher. Together Dr. and Mrs. Howard Taylor authored several books:</s><s>Published works. - \"These Forty Years\" 1908 - \"Hudson Taylor and The China Inland Mission Vol. 1 Hudson Taylor in Early Years: The Growth of a Soul\" 1911 - \"Hudson Taylor and The China Inland Mission Vol. 2 The Growth of a Work of God\" 1918 - \"Hudson Taylor's Spiritual Secret\" 1932</s><s>Continued service. Mary Geraldine Guinness was a noteworthy####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### missionary in her own right with a love of writing. She joined the CIM in 1888 and became one of the key biographers for the CIM. She served in Honan before they were married. She was already the author of a few books including \"The Story of the China Inland Mission\" and \"In the Far East\". Howard Taylor took risks to serve the mission in China. In 1898, for nine months he was acting superintendent in Henan while suffering from intractable dysentery. When he asked to be replaced and freed to get proper treatment, his father, Hudson Taylor, confessed that he had no one available to take over. He urged Howard to stay on and Howard Taylor did. In 1901, when the Student Volunteer Movement invited Dr. Howard Taylor and his wife to be the speakers among the colleges and universities. Ten years after his service began in China, in 1900, he and his wife made a special tour of the American colleges, again at the invitation of the Student volunteer Missionary Union. This was considered one of the most notable campaigns ever conducted among North American institutions by secretaries of the Student Volunteer Movement on overseas missions. They began the mobilization tour in November 1900, continuing with some interruptions, until April 1901. In less than 5 months####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, between November 1900 and April 1901, Dr Howard Taylor visited 77 different institutions of learning, including 40 medical schools, 10 theological seminaries, 21 universities and colleges, and six other schools. His aim was to present to medical students the opportunities for service on the mission field, so that only those other colleges could be visited that were in or near the largest cities. This work necessitated about 4000 miles of travel, as far north as Montreal and Minneapolis, and as far south as Baltimore and Nashville. Mrs. Taylor went to the women\u2019s colleges of the eastern states. By January they were traveling together on Canadian and western tours. In all, Mrs. Taylor visited nearly as many institutions as did her husband. Their contribution was so much appreciated that the Student Volunteer Movement invited them to become traveling speakers for a whole year in 1912. On Saturday 3 June 1905 Howard and Geraldine were there when Hudson Taylor died at Changsha. They had been traveling with him since April visiting the different mission stations along the Yangtze, calling at various ports, to Hankow, then by rail into Henan, and finally to Changsha, the capital of Hunan. At the memorial service held at the China Inland Mission Hall in Shanghai on 13 June, Dr. Howard Taylor####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### spoke about his father\u2019s life, quoting from Hudson Taylor and how his father constantly challenged him, In February 1922, Howard and his wife were kidnapped by a bandit leader in Yunnan named Pu Shuming. They were subsequently released. Geraldine recorded the events of the ordeal in \"With P\u2019u and His Brigands\".

She was part of the Russian New Wave literary movement. She was cited by Joseph Brodsky as the best living poet in the Russian language. She is known in Russia as \"the voice of the epoch\". Despite the aforementioned apolitical stance of her writing, Akhmadulina was often critical of authorities in the Soviet Union, and spoke out in favour of others, including Nobel laureates Boris Pasternak, Andrei Sakharov, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. She was known to international audiences via her travels abroad during the Khrushchev Thaw, during which she made appearances in sold-out stadiums. Upon her death in 2010 at the age of 73, President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev hailed her poetry as a \"classic of Russian literature.\" \"The New York Times\" said Akhmadulina was \"always recognized as one of the Soviet Union's literary treasures and a classic poet in the long line extending from Lermontov and Pushkin.\" Sonia I.

Bella Akhmadulina was born in Moscow on 10 April 1937, the only child of Akhat Valeevich Akhmadulin, a Tatar father and Nadezhda Makarovna Lazareva, a Russian-Italian mother. They underwent evacuation to Kazan when World War II broke out. Akhmadulina's literary career began when she was a school-girl working as a journalist at the Moscow newspaper, \"Metrostroevets\", and improving her poetic skills at a circle organized by the poet Yevgeny Vinokurov. Her first poems appeared in the magazine \"October\" after being approved by established Soviet poets.  These first poems were published in 1955. \u00c9migr\u00e9 critic Marc Slonim described her prospects as follows in 1964 (\"Soviet Russian Literature\"): \"Her voice has such a purity of tone, such richness of timbre, such individuality of diction,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### that if her growth continues she will be able some day to succeed Akhmatova\" as \"the greatest living woman poet in Russia\". After finishing school, Akhmadulina entered the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute from which she graduated in 1960. While studying at the institute, she published her poems and articles in different newspapers, both official and handwritten. She was the subject of criticism in \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" in 1957. She was expelled in 1959 (but allowed re-entry as time progressed) as a result of her opposition to the persecution of Boris Pasternak. In 1962 the first collection of her poems, titled \"Struna\" (\"The String\"), was published and was a resounding success. In spite of being expunged, many of her collections of verses were published later: \"Music lessons\" (1970), \"Poems\" (1975), \"Candle\" (1977), \"Dreams of Georgia\" (1977), \"The Mystery\" (1983), \"Coastline\" (1991), and others.

His works were banned under the Suppression of Communism Act, and he faced severe restrictions as a writer. At the same time, he became the first black South African journalist to win a Nieman Fellowship from Harvard University to pursue his studies. When he applied for permission to go to United States, Nkosi was granted a one-way exit permit to leave South Africa, thus being barred from returning. In 1961, accepting the scholarship to study at Harvard (1961\u20131962), he began a 30-year exile. In 1962, he attended the African Writers Conference at Makerere University, along with the likes of Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Ezekiel Mphahlele. Moving to London, Nkosi obtained work with the BBC and between 1962 and 1965 produced the radio programme \"Africa Abroad\", also interviewing major African writers for the television series \"African Writers of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Today\" on NET, and serving as literary editor for \"The New African\" magazine (1965\u20131968).

Lewis Nkosi returned to South Africa in 2001, after a gap of nearly four decades. His final years before his death in 2010 were passed in financial difficulties and ill health. He was apparently injured in a car crash in 2009 and spent his time on the bed, slowly recuperating from the wounds; however, a recovery never really happened and he drifted towards death. Despite Nkosi being considered an African literary legend, none of his efforts in literature gave him any economic relief and his friends and fans gathered a charity fund to pay####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### his last medical bills.

A memorial service for Nkosi was held on 8 September at the Museum Africa, Newtown Cultural Precinct, in Johannesburg, and his funeral took place in Durban on 10 September.</s><s>Works.</s><s>Works.:Novels. Though Nkosi started his literary career in the 1960s, he entered the realm of fiction much later than his \"Drum\" colleagues. His first novel, \"Mating Birds\", was published in 1983. His next novel, \"Underground People\", came out in 2002 and his third novel, \"Mandela's Ego\", in 2006. \"Mating Birds\" (1986) \"Mating Birds\" is the narration of an educated South African black native called Ndi Sibiya. He narrates the story from prison, awaiting a death sentence. As a jobless youth Sibiya wanders the city of Durban and reaches the segregated beach. There he finds a white girl on the other side of the fence (on the white side of the beach).####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### They silently exchange looks and enter into a muted affair. They were well aware that race laws in South Africa would sentence them to imprisonment if caught. The white girl intentionally allows her naked body to be seen by Sibiya. He takes the entire episode as a love affair between the white girl and himself. The girl with her regular appearances on the beach and seeming interest dupes Sibiya into believing her. After several silent meetings on the beach, Sibiya follows her to her bungalow, finds her lonely and willing, and enters into sexual copulation. But they are discovered by neighbours, and the white girl accuses Sibiya of rape. A trial by white judges begins. In the court, the white girl, Veronica, denies any knowledge of Sibiya and reiterates the charge of rape against him. The court finds Sibiya guilty and sentences him to death. The novel generated a controversy and received critical attention, being awarded the Macmillan Silver Pen Prize in 1986. \"The New York Times\" declared the novel one of the best hundred books of 1986. \"Underground People\" (2002) Nkosi's second novel, \"Underground People\", is a political thriller. In this novel, he moved away from the theme of inter####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-racial sexual relations and centred the story on the armed struggle in South Africa. Cornelius Molapo is a language teacher and a member of the National Liberation Movement, an organisation waging armed war against the racist white minority government. He is a poet, a great orator, hungry reader of many books, and even plays cricket. He often criticises the policy of the Central Committee and irks its members. To counter him, they draw a strategy. The Central Committee of the Organization advises Cornelius to go to a remote part of the country called Tabanyane and to participate in peasant uprisings. The Central Committee plans to make use of his absence from mainstream life into an act of abduction by the Government. At first he hesitates, but reluctantly agrees. After reaching Tabanyane, Cornelius organises the poor illiterate jobless country men into revolutionary men and leads them. In this task, he enlists the support of Princess Madi, who is a daughter of the deposed chief of Tabanyane. During the clandestine operations, he takes two white hostages into his custody. However, he is unwilling to execute the unarmed civilians. Meanwhile, the Central Committee starts a big propaganda about the disappearance of Cornelius from duties. They blame it on the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### South African police, who deny any knowledge of him. The National Liberation Movement brings the matter to international organisations like the United Nations and Human Rights International. The latter sends its official Anthony Ferguson, who was born in South Africa and immigrated to England, to investigate the matter. Anthony's sister and mother are still living in South Africa. After some rest he undertakes to search for Cornelius unsuccessfully. The Central Committee members, plagued by jealousy of his success as a revolutionary, want to use the issue of white hostages for the release of their leader from prison, engage in talks with the Government and to observe a ceasefire. But contrary to the expectations of the Central Committee, Cornelius defies them and conducts attacks on the police stations and other locations. To escape police persecution, Cornelius leaves his hideout, and allows the white hostages to leave unharmed. The white hostages reach police and recognise Cornelius's photo and confirm his active presence in the fight. Naturally, police suspect the intentions of Anthony Ferguson and ask him to go to Tabanyane, to convince Cornelius to surrender. He takes the help of a member of the Central Committee and reaches Tabanyane. However, Cornelius refuses to surrender and ditch the people for whom he had been fighting. Eventually,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the police shoot, and he dies. \"Mandela's Ego\" (2006) Nkosi's third novel, \"Mandela's Ego\" (2006), is the story of Dumisani Gumede, a teenage boy who has come of age in a Zulu village and runs after every girl and woman to satiate his newly acquired power. His uncle Simon tells him many stories about Nelson Mandela and makes him a follower of the great leader. Uncle Simon's storytelling is invested with lies and half-truths. He also tells Dumisani that Mandela is a great pursuer of women. Taking cue from the \"real life\" of Mandela, Dumisani goes unstopped in his conquests. In his village, every girl falls for his charms except Nobuhle, a beautiful orphaned girl. Dumisani's admiration for Mandela goes to the extent of starting a football club, with Dumisani as its chairman. He even goes to the city of Pietermartizburg to see Mandela, who comes there to address a convention demanding equal rights for all races and a dialogue among all the races. After his schooling, Dumisani joins a tourist company as a guide. Dumisani's friend Sofa Sonke, driver of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### tourist bus, brings every day a newspaper from Durban for him. After many attempts to win Nobuhle, Dumisani finally succeeds and gets accepted by her. She invites him to meet her on the river bank. On the same day, Dumisani receives the news of Mandela's arrest. The news shocks him and takes his nerve away. When Dumisani tries to unite with Nobuhle, his body fails. He tries again but his sexual energy deserts him. Nobuhle leaves in tears. Dumisani consults many witch doctors, tribal doctors and conventional doctors in hospitals. But nothing works to cure him. He leaves his home, wanders the country aimlessly for years. When he reaches middle age, one day he hears the news of Mandela's release from prison. He attends the first public address of Mandela after the release. He rejoices. In his joy, he huddles a woman next to him, and his lost sexual urge returns. His life is restored. \"Mandela's Ego\" was shortlisted for the 2007 \"Sunday Times\" Fiction Award.</s><s>Works.:Drama.

Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez was part of a group of former students from the UV who were hired by the government to work at the television company. But after demanding better working conditions and facing censorship from the company, she left the company to pursue a career in print media.</s><s>Career. Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez worked for several newspapers in Chiapas, like \"El Sol de Chiapas\" and \"N\u00famero Uno\", for five years before she returned to her home state of Veracruz, where she became the editorial assistant of the news channel \"Cuatro M\u00e1s\". The journalist then left to work for the daily \"Pol\u00edtica\", where she covered topics on security and social justice. Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez was also a journalist and investigative crime reporter for the \"Diario de Xalapa\" newspaper. Her journalistic career in Veracru####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####z, however, faced several challenges from the political elite; governors and government secretaries wanted to censor Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez for criticizing their administration. Instead of self-censoring like other media outlets in the state, she became known for her direct reporting style, which frequently angered the authorities. She wrote over 63 reports covering political assassinations, natural disasters, authority abuses, human right violations, corruption, and government mismanagement. After working for the \"Diario de Xalapa\", Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez became a local correspondent for the newspaper \"La Jornada\" in the state and later joined the news magazine \"Proceso\", where she worked for more than ten years. The news magazine is well known for having an \"anti-establishment publication\" style, and often runs articles that criticize politicians across the country. Many of its reporters have been threatened in the past for their journalistic coverage. In \"Proceso\", Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez was an open critic of government corruption and abuse of authority, and wrote extensively on the local drug trade and organized crime. She was particularly known in Mexico for her in-depth reporting on the Mexican drug cartels and how they corrupted government officials in Veracruz. Among her last publications before####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### her murder was a political profile about Reynaldo Escobar P\u00e9rez and Alejandro Montano, two politicians of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who were running for office in Congress. A week before her murder she had also written about an incident in which the Mexican Navy arrested nine policemen in the state who were allegedly working for a drug trafficking organization, the arrest of a high-profile leader of Los Zetas drug cartel known as \"Comandante Chaparro\", and a story involving mayor Mart\u00edn Padua Z\u00fa\u00f1iga from the National Action Party (PAN) who was arrested with drug traffickers following a gunfight with the Mexican Army.</s><s>Death. Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez was murdered early in the morning of 28 April 2012 in her home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto neighborhood in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz. When police went to her home to investigate in response to a neighbor's call about her door being open all day, Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez's corpse was found on the bathroom floor. According to official reports, she had been severely beaten around her face and ribs, and then strangled to death. The cause of death was asphyxia by strangulation. At the time####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of her death, the Mexican authorities said they were investigating all the possible motives behind her assassination, including personal motives and theft, and that they would investigate whether the killing was work-related. In October 2012, new details emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez Silva (alias \"El Silva\") and Jos\u00e9 Adri\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez Dom\u00ednguez (alias \"El Jarocho\"), two men who were alleged to have murdered Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the reporter knew Dom\u00ednguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house on the night of her murder. After some conversation, Dom\u00ednguez grew angry and started beating Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to overpower her as she only weighed 108\u00a0lbs (48.9\u00a0kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.</s><s>Death.:Investigation. When Silva was arrested in October 2012, he confessed to the murder of Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez. Investigators and authorities in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. When placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and Dom\u00ednguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. \"Proceso\" news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, \"Proceso\" was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. \"Proceso\" has complained that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation. Six months after Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez's slaying, the Veracruz authorities stated that her murder was also a crime of passion. According to the reports, Dom\u00ednguez was the alleged boyfriend of the journalist. In April 2013, \"Proceso\" stated that it had received classified information that its senior editor who was covering the investigation,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Jorge Carrasco, was a possible target by corrupt Veracruz officials. Reportedly, members of the administration of Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa were allowed to carry out \"hostile actions against the reporter in response to his most recent publication on the Regina Mart\u00ednez case.\" Sources close to the news magazine alleged that officials were plotting to kill the reporter while he was in the nation's capital, Mexico City. The Veracruz authorities responded by stating that the accusations were false and asked \"Proceso\" to provide evidence for its claims. The governor promised that he would investigate the threats, and the journalist went into hiding with several armed bodyguards. That same month, Silva was sentenced to 38 years and 2 months in prison for the murder. The judge also ordered the murderer to pay roughly US$8,000 in reparations for her death and the stolen possessions. \"Proceso\", however, expressed its doubt on the murder case and trial once again, stating that they did not believe the court was sentencing the right man. Many journalists continue to dispute the facts in the case, believing that the murder was retribution for reports by Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez on drug trafficking and political corruption; they have questioned the investigation by the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### state of Veracruz. \"Proceso\" magazine's reporter said the investigators never explored the possibility that her journalism may have been the motive behind her murder. Press freedom organizations across the world have complained that the case was designed to cover up the crime instead of clarifying what actually happened. \"We don't believe them [the authorities]\", said \"Proceso\" reporter Jorge Carrasco on behalf of the whole newspaper magazine. The case was the subject of a podcast  by A Safer World for Truth and openDemocracy released in December 2021.</s><s>Context.</s><s>Context.:Background. Veracruz is the most dangerous place in Mexico for journalists; at least nine journalists have been killed since Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa took office in 2010, many of them by the Los Zetas drug cartel. Most of these reporters were killed under unclear circumstances, and few arrests have been made in their respective investigations. Given the high levels of corruption, criminal impunity, and drug-related attacks against the press all across Veracruz, many local journalists have decided to leave the state and relocate in other parts of Mexico. The atmosphere in Veracruz has also forced many media outlets to self-censor and stop reporting####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### on the drug violence. With traditional reporting being too dangerous and intimidating, social media and blogs are often the only outlets for reporting serious crimes. The state of Veracruz used to be controlled by the Gulf Cartel before business was handed over to Los Zetas, their former allies, when they went to war across northeastern Mexico in early 2010. Since 2011, much of the drug-related violence is a result of the turf wars between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel, a drug trafficking organization based in western Mexico and headed by Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, Mexico's most-wanted drug lord. These criminal groups are fighting for Veracruz because of its lucrative smuggling routes for contraband, drug trafficking, and illegal migrants heading to the United States. It has one of Mexico's busiest ports, and officials say that there is no way they can inspect all of the containers that come in by ship. Corruption is also widespread in Veracruz; investigators have been slow and reluctant to link the Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez murder to organized crime. According to the committee to Protect Journalists, Veracruz is by \"general consensus one of the most politically corrupt [states in Mexico]\".####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Mexico was ruled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) for 71 years until it lost the presidential seat to the conservative National Action Party (PAN) in 2000. The PRI has long been criticized for being corrupt and allowing the drug trafficking organizations in the country to operate freely if they maintained relative peace. Although the PRI lost the national presidency in 2000, some states remained under the rule of PRI politicians. \"Democratic transition never quite reached Veracruz,\" a state of 8 million people. PRI governors in Veracruz continued to rule with the state with tactics largely abandoned by the PRI at a national level.</s><s>Context.:Journalists assassinated. Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez was the fifth journalist killed in Veracruz during the \"sexenio\" of Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa, which started in 2010. The first journalist assassinated was Noel L\u00f3pez Olgu\u00edn (March 2011), followed by Miguel \u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez Velasco and his son Miseal (June 2011). Then Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz was killed (July 2011), followed by Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez (April 2012). Just a few days after her death, the mutilated bodies####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of four media professionals were discovered. There would be still another journalist murdered in Veracruz: V\u00edctor Manuel B\u00e1ez (June 2012). Although not officially counted in the death toll of journalists, at least three journalists have been kidnapped and have remained in captivity since 2010: Manuel Gabriel Fonseca Hern\u00e1ndez (September 2011), Miguel Morales Estrada (July 2012), and Sergio Landa Rosales (November 2012). Nearly 100 journalists, bloggers and writers have been kidnapped or killed in Mexico since 2000, making the country one of the most dangerous places on the planet in which to be a journalist. Most of these crimes, too, have remained unsolved, and only a few perpetrators have been brought to justice. On 22 June 2012, former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n signed the \"Law for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists\" (Spanish: \"Ley Para la Protecci\u00f3n de Personas Defensoras de Derechos Humanos y Periodistas\"), which makes attacks against journalists a federal crime and establishes a fund for investigating these crimes. The law also establishes several preventative measures to protect journalists, such as providing them bodyguards, armored vehicles, bullet-proof vests, security cameras, wireless equipment and satellite####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### cellphones to communicate in case of any danger, and temporary relocation if deemed necessary. Congress passed a law on 7 June 2012 that allowed the federal government to investigate attacks against journalists, crimes which used to be under the jurisdiction of state and municipal forces.</s><s>Reactions. Irina Bokova, who is the Director-General of UNESCO, said, \"News of the murders of Gabriel Huge and Guillermo Luna Varela \u2013 tortured and killed less than one week after the murder of Regina Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez \u2013 is deeply disturbing, and reflects an alarming state of affairs in the state of Veracruz. That these gruesome crimes have been committed on the eve of World Press Freedom Day \u2013 a day on which we honour the vital role played by journalists in upholding democratic values, protecting citizens' rights to be informed and calling those in power to account \u2013 makes the situation all the more intolerable. I condemn these three murders in the strongest possible terms and urge the Mexican authorities to act quickly and decisively to find those responsible. Impunity is not an option.\" \"Proceso\" magazine wrote, in reaction to its colleague's murder, \"The murder of journalist Regina Martinez Perez, on Saturday April 28, is the result of a broken country, a situation####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of daily violence in which extreme acts are not the exception but the rule daily.\" On 29 April 2013, the Chamber of Deputies of Mexico observed a moment of silence to remember Regina Mart\u00ednez, after a proposal made by Manuel Rafael Huerta from the Labor Party (PT). Huerta mentioned in his petition that a year after the murder the circumstances were still unclear and the official version from the government of Veracruz was not to be believed. The president of the chamber left those comments out, but found the proposal relevant and invited deputies to join in the minute of silence. In 2020 Forbidden Stories coordinated reports of international journalists on Mexican drug cartels, which included continuation of Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez' work.</s><s>See also. - Mexican Drug War - List of journalists killed in Mexico - List of unsolved murders</s>", "Regina Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez was a Mexican journalist known for her coverage of organized crime and corruption in Mexico.

He was admitted to the Puerto Rico Bar that year and practiced as a private lawyer from 1969 to 1975.</s><s>Political career. In 1976, after initially expressing an interest in becoming Mayor of San Juan and running in an unofficial internal primary within the NPP, Corrada del R\u00edo was elected Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. During his tenure (1977\u20131985), he advocated for the admission of Puerto Rico into the Union####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and co-founded the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Corrada served as Mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, from 1985 to 1989 (having won the 1984 mayoral election). In the elections of 1988, Corrada made an unsuccessful bid to become Governor of Puerto Rico. He was defeated by incumbent Governor Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n. In January 1993, Pedro Rossell\u00f3 became Governor and appointed Corrada as Puerto Rico's 15th Secretary of State. Later, in 1995, Rossell\u00f3 appointed Corrada as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. He took the oath of office on July 15, 1995, after unanimous confirmation in the Senate of Puerto Rico. During his tenure as Associate Justice, Corrada was among the moderate/conservative voices in the Court, usually adhering to strict interpretations of the Constitution while practicing a firm type of judicial restraint. The Constitution of Puerto Rico mandates an obligatory retirement for the Justices of the Supreme Court at age 70. Corrada arrived at this age in April, 2005, and was forced to retire. Prior to his retirement, Corrada publicly asked for an amendment to the Constitution that would repeal the obligatory retirement age for the justices, arguing that by obligating people to retire the constitution####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### is discriminating by reason of age.

Governor An\u00edbal Acevedo Vil\u00e1 did not nominate anyone for the position after then-Senate President Kenneth McClintock made it clear in his inaugural speech as Senate president in 2005 that only a well-qualified statehooder would muster the votes for Senate confirmation to Court seats previously held by statehooders in order to assure \"balance\" on the bench. He was eventually succeeded in 2009 by Rafael Martinez-Torres, appointed by a Corrada protege, governor Luis Fortu\u00f1o. Corrada last served as \"of counsel\" to Puerto Rico's largest law firm, McConnell Vald\u00e9s, of which he had been a partner prior to holding elective office. upon his retirement from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, he announced that he would abstain from political activity for one year, and on March 14, 2006, announced that within a month would begin attending New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico meetings, as former party president####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, to provide discrete advice. He also publicly disagreed with then-party president Pedro Rossello by objecting to the expulsion of then-Senate President Kenneth McClintock and then-Vice President Orlando Parga from the party for refusing to turn over the Senate presidency to Rossello.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Gonzalo Fonseca Gonzalo Fonseca (2 July 1922 \u2013 11 June 1997) was a Uruguayan artist known for his stone sculpting. He originally studied to be an architect at the University of Montevideo, but discovered modern art in 1942 after working in the Taller Torres-Garcia workshop. He studied painting in the workshop until 1949, and became interested in pre-Columbian art during that time. Fonseca is frequently associated with the movement Universal Constructivism.</s><s>Biography. Fonseca was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, in July 1922. He traveled to Europe in the 1930s, and was exposed to archaeology, anthropology, and history. Fonseca also taught himself to sculpt in stone and paint with watercolor. In 1939, he began studying architecture at the University of Montevideo. However, in 1942 Fonseca left the University to work with Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda. While working at the Torres-Garcia workshop, he became more diverse in his techniques, trying sculpting, painting, ceramics, and drawing. During the course of the 1940s, Fonseca traveled through Peru and Bolivia, studying art with other members####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of the Torres-Garcia workshop. In 1950 he left Uruguay, and traveled through several countries in Europe and the Middle East. Fonseca worked in excavations run by Flinders Petrie in Egypt, Sudan, Syria, and traveled through Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Greece. These archeological digs would prove fundamental in his future artworks. While living in Europe, he worked in ceramics as well as painting. He met and married Elizabeth Kaplan, from New York City, in the mid-1950s (and divorced two decades later) and moved to Manhattan in 1958 after being awarded a Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. He had four children, Quina, Bruno, Caio, and Isabel with Elizabeth Kaplan, two of whom (Bruno Fonseca and Caio Fonseca) became renowned artists.{{cite news |title= Gonzalo Fonseca,74; Carved Enigmas in Stone In 1962 Fonseca had his first exhibition in the United States, at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. This exhibition contained mostly flat compositions, as was common with the works done by the Torres-Garcia workshop at that time. Fonseca also created wooden reliefs for this####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### exhibition, which laid a foundation for his three-dimensional art. He began working in New York and in Italy, near Carrara. It is in the 1970s that he focuses on painting towards sculpture and on three-dimensional architectural forms. He started working on large scale pieces mostly of marble, and recycled limestone from New York's demolished buildings. In 1983, he became a citizen of the United States. During the late 1970s and 1980s he became more focused on towers, such as \"Torre del recien nacido\" (\"Tower of the Newborn Child\") and \"Torre de los vientos\". He had few solo shows throughout his career, but several group exhibitions in which he became known for his stone sculptures of modern influenced architectural forms. He died in Italy at the age of 74 in Seravezza, Italy, in his studio.</s><s>Iconology. As a Universal Constructivist, Fonseca sought to focus on art outside of nationality. This is clear in the amount of traveling and excavating he did, not trying to define a national identity but rather a universal identity, free of false stereotypes. Fonseca's influence on his art derived from a fascination with history and cultures, and his early training as an architect####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### helped him realize and formulate his sculptures. His pieces offer a sense of mystery, and yet a deeper meaning. Fonseca's sculptures take architectural reference as well as that of ancient ruins and what he studied while taking part in excavations. This causes the viewer to recognize and identify parts of the sculpture, perhaps relating them to the characteristics of a building or home. But the way in which he manifests these pieces still leaves something to be defined by the viewer in relation to time and space. His works do not automatically construct a definite time period in the viewer's mind, leaving it to the imagination as to what it may or may not represent in time and space. Fonseca was very interested in the nature and history of the stones used in his sculpture. While working in the quarries, he would notice the changes in the stone due to climate. It is said that the fragile nature of many of these stones is why Fonseca had so few exhibitions: sand did not travel well. Fonseca's sculpture has two clear features. The first is the intimacy that causes one to relate innately to his works. The other feature is the grandeur in his sculpture, strengthened by the simplicity of the geometric forms. His art is known as \"a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### journey through the history of archeology.\" The archeological basis stems from Precolombian architecture as well as Eastern Mediterranean, and even New York City architecture. It was clear that archeology spread through all of Fonseca's work. Fonseca's artworks also tend to be a labyrinth of thought. Some of the works contain inscriptions that may give a glimpse, but do not truly allow much insight into his mind. There are many stairways and ladders in his sculptures, which lead to tombs such as the quarries he worked in. Fonseca shared that these ladders also show the \"descent into the infernos.\"</s><s>Selected artworks. \"Torre de los vientos\" (\"\"Tower of the Winds\"\"), 1974. This sculpture was constructed as a tribute to the Greek architect Andronicus. Andronicus had built a tower in Athens to commemorate the gods of the winds. Fonseca's tribute had four sides, each side with Latin inscriptions indicating the four different kinds of winds in Greek mythology. The four winds are the North wind known as Boreas, which brought hail; the East morning wind known as Eurus; the South wind known as Noto, which####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### brought sorrow; and the mild wind from the West known as Zephirus, which was feared by the sailors. The dome on top likely symbolizes the center of the world, with its inscription \"Onphalos\". \"El Pilar\" (\"\"The Pilar\"\"), 1986, 1990, 1997. This sculpture was precisely carved and was placed in three separate contexts: Seravezza, Italy, Pietrasanta, Italy, and the entrance of Uruguay's Pavilion at the XLIV Biennale Di Venezia. It contains a ladder, which is common in Fonseca's work, which is known to relate to both the Hebrew ladder of Jacob and also the ladders in the quarries he excavated in. \"Columbarium Major\", 1976. This sculpture is known for its contrast in change of scale. There are multiple cuts into the wood filled with geometric forms, as well as his well-known stairways. This artwork also contains \"betilos\", known as sacred stones. \"La Casa\" (\"\"The House\"\"), 1963. This artwork was a relief painting with engravings of ladders and figures. It also included wood-carved objects hanging from the top corner of the painting. \"Graneros III\", 1971\u2013####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####1975. This work was part of horizontal, heavy slabs that were displayed as urban projects for participants to interact with. It was carved of red travertine marble. It mimics the form of an actual grain store, but also refers to a store of knowledge, with the grain representing the knowledge.</s><s>XIX Olympiad. Fonseca designed and created a 12-meter high concrete tower as his contribution to the Route of Friendship (Spanish: La Ruta de la Amistad) of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. It was titled \"Torre\". This structure recalls the shape of the Malwiya, the spiral minaret of the Great Mosque of Samarra. It is hollow, and was later converted into a studio, then used as an artists' exhibition space from 1997 to 2004. The XIX Olympiad was significant in that these were the first Olympic Games held in Latin America. The \"Route of Friendship\" contained nineteen concrete sculptures on the highway surrounding the capital. This was a collaboration of architect Pedro Ramirez Vasquez and German sculptor Mathias Goeritz. The goal was to give a universal quality to the Games with sculptures from around the world. This structure is not to be confused with \"La Torre de####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### los Vientos\", or \"The Tower of the Winds\", which was built in 1974 as a tribute.{{cite book |last1= Reyes |first1= Pedro|editor1-first= Julie Rodrigues |editor1-last=Widholm |title= Escultura social: a new generation of art from Mexico City |year= 2007 |publisher= Yale University Press|language= en, es |isbn=978-0-300-13427-8</s><s>Selected exhibitions.</s><s>Selected exhibitions.:Solo exhibitions. - 1952 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca Paintings,\" Studio Claudio Matinenghi, Roma - 1953 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca Ceramica,\" Galleria San Marco, Roma - 1962 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca, Selected Artworks\", The Portland Museum, Oregon - 1970 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca, Recent Works,\" The Jewish Museum, New York - 1974 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca,\" Galeria Conkright, Caracas - 1976 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca,\" Galeria Adler / Castillo, Caracas - 1977 \u2013 \"Sculture di Gonzalo Fon####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####seca,\" Galleria del Naviglio, Milan - 1978 \u2013 \"Fonseca,\" Fiera di Bologna, Italy - 1986 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca: Sculpture,\" Arnold Herstand Gallery, New York - 1988 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca: Sculpture and Drawings,\" Arnold Herstand Gallery, New York - 1989 \u2013 \"Fonseca, Sculpture and Drawings\", The Arts Club of Chicago, Illinois - 1991 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca, Sabbakhin, Sculpture\", Arnold Herstand Gallery, New York - 1994 \u2013 \"Mundos de Gonzalo Fonseca,\" Museo de Bellas Artes, Caracas - 1999 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca,\" Fundacion Cesar Manrique, Lanzarote - 2003 \u2013 \"Gonzalo Fonseca,\" IVAM Institut Valencia d\u2019Art Modern, Valencia</s><s>Selected exhibitions.:Group exhibitions. - 1946 \u2013 \"Arte de America,\" Maison de l\u2019Amerique, Paris - 1950 \u2013 \"Torres-Garcia & his Workshop,\" OAS Museum, Washington, D.C. - 1954 \u2013 Bien####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####al de Arte, S\u00e3o Paulo - 1960 \u2013 \"4 Constructivist works of the El Taller Torres-Garcia,\" The New School University, New York - 1970 \u2013 \"Universalismo Constructivo,\" Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Buenos Aires - 1986 \u2013 \"Torres-Garcia and his Legacy,\" Kouros Gallery, New York - 1987 \u2013 \"Latin American Artists in New York since 1970,\" A.M.

When####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### she arrived in London, Wardere sought treatment for her wounds, but received little support from the NHS.

Years later, when she was studying to become a teaching assistant, she opened up about her story in a homework essay. The head of staff read her work and asked her to deliver a speech to 120 teachers, during which some realised that their students might have experienced the same trauma. After reading Wardere's essay, school governor Clare Coghill booked Wardere appointments with other schools in the area. Wardere has worked as a mediator and FGM educator since then, helping young students escape FGM. She also delivers awareness raising sessions to doctors and the Police to assist in their understanding of FGM.

Her family ran a liquor wholesaler at Kanagawa-d\u014dri 4-ch\u014dme in Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama, where she lived until the building was burnt down in the American firebombing of 29 May 1945, an event in which her father sustained fatal burns. Her elder brother had used a Rolleicord camera and a darkroom, and this combined with a desire to work among men led Tokiwa to want to work as a photographer, even before she had used a camera herself. Tokiwa graduated from Tokyo Kasei-Gakuin (the predecessor of Tokyo Kasei-Gakuin Junior College) in 1951. She started work as an announcer but dreamt of being a photographer instead, joining the women-only Shirayuri Camera Club (, \"Shirayuri Kamera Kurabu\"); she was influenced by the realism of Japanese photography at the time (led by Ken Domon). Some####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of Tokiwa's earliest photographs are of \u014csanbashi, the pier in Yokohama at which American ships docked and that was thus the site of emotional partings and reunions of American military families. She was able to photograph close up without attracting any comment, and greatly enjoyed the work. But she quickly moved to her main interest, working women. Despite an initial hatred of the American military, prompted in particular by her father's death, and revulsion at prostitution, she simply invited herself into the \"akasen\" (red-light area) of Yokohama, asked the girls whether she might photograph, and was accepted. Tokiwa would later marry an amateur photographer, (, 1914\u20131995) \u2013 whose photography of postwar Japan appears with hers in a 1996 book \u2013 and work as both housewife and photojournalist.

In 1957, her book \"Kiken na Adabana\" (, literally \"Dangerous toxic/fruitless flowers\"), was published by Mikasa Shob\u014d. Its text is divided into three parts: - \"Kiken na adabana\" (as explained above) - \"F\u0101sutofurekkusu kara Kyanon made\" (i.e. \"From Firstflex to Canon\"; the Firstflex was a brand of twin-lens reflex camera made by Tokiwa Seiki, ) - \"K\u014dfuku e no iriguchi no aru ie\" (i.e. \"A house with an entrance to happiness\") Each of these is further subdivided into short essays. The text is in the first person and often about Tokiwa herself: the (composite) cover photograph and the photograph in the frontispiece both show Tokiwa holding a Canon rangefinder camera, in a period when photography was very much a male pursuit in Japan. The text of the book is interrupted by four sections of photographs, taken between 1952 and 1957 (capt####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ions and technical data appear on pp.\u00a0242\u2013241).

In March 2013, Shayne was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing. After the 2013 Federal election, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs and for Ageing. In 2016, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. After the 2019 Federal election, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Defence Personnel.</s><s>Early life. Neumann was born in Ipswich, Queensland. Neither of his parents completed high school; his father was a meatworker and his mother was a shop assistant. In his maiden speech, he stated: \"In my childhood, I was exposed to the twin evils of addiction to alcohol and gambling. I lived through the poverty caused thereby and the pain of the divorce which followed.\" Neumann attended Ipswich East State Primary School and Bundamba State Secondary College. His first job was as a cleaner at a meatworks in Dinmore. He completed a Bachelors of Arts majoring in government and economics, and a Bachelor of Laws####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### from the University of Queensland. Shayne was a partner in the Brisbane-based law firm of Neumann and Turnour Lawyers, which he established at the age of 26 in partnership with Matthew Turnour (brother of former Federal MP Jim Turnour). He specialised in family law.</s><s>Political career. Neumann has cited the rise of Pauline Hanson in his home town of Ipswich as his motivation for becoming more involved in politics. Neumann was the Labor candidate for Blair at the 2004 federal election, and was heavily defeated by sitting Liberal member Cameron Thompson who received 61.21 percent of the two-party-preferred vote. Blair was considered a Liberal safe seat at the time. Neumann sought a rematch in 2007. This time, he was aided by two factors. Firstly, a redistribution of the electoral boundaries, finalised in 2006, pushed Blair further into Ipswich while cutting out the conservative-leaning rural towns of Esk and Kingaroy, roughly halving Thompson's majority and putting Blair just outside the range of seats that Labor would have needed to win government. Secondly, there was a big Labor resurgence across the country at the 2007 federal election under the leadership of Kevin Rudd. This resurgence was at its greatest in Rudd's home state of Queensland. Ne####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####umann won the seat on a swing of 10.17 points. Neumann was re-elected in 2010 with only a modest swing against him. He was re-elected in 2013, actually picking up a small swing in his favour as Labor lost government. In 2016, Neumann technically made Blair a safe Labor seat by taking 58.88 percent of the two-party vote. Neumann supported Rudd in the Australian Labor Party leadership spill on 26 June 2013. He stated that \"it was a really tough decision because I thought it was in the best interests of our state and of the people in my electorate.\" In Labor's October 2013 leadership spill, Neumann supported Bill Shorten.</s><s>Political career.:Political positions.

Neumann had publicly stated his opposition to same sex marriage in August 2011, August 2013, and June 2015. In December 2015, Neumann confirmed his newfound support of same sex marriage.

In an interview with Radio New Zealand in September 2013, Tukaki also indicated a strong desire for business to play a primary role in developing technological advances as a way to solve some of the \"big challenges of our time\". Tukaki retired from his role as Australian Representative to the United Nations Global Compact in November 2013. In his memoir, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart. Vice Chair of the United Nations Global Compact and former chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, recognised Tukaki's work and leadership during the reform process after he was elected as chairman of the Local Networks Advisory Group. The significance of the reform agenda led to a range of new initiatives being developed such as a new collaborative fundraising framework, deeper engagement with transnational and multinational corporations, and a frontier fund to help United Nations Global Compact Networks with material and financial support. In February 2014, Tukaki announced the formation####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of a new global initiative to be known as EntreHub.

In July, Tukaki was elected to the National Executive of the New Zealand M\u0101ori Council with a clear agenda on moving the council towards leading the national social policy debate. This new agenda began to emerge across a number of fronts including suicide prevention, homelessness and the affordability of life extending and life saving drugs for M\u0101ori. The latter was the first call to the M\u0101ori Affairs Select Committee of the New Zealand Parliament in its history. He was then appointed Executive Director of the Council. Tukaki was not re-elected to the Auckland District Council in the following, 2021, triennial election and became ineligible to continue as Executive Director. Tukaki continued to operate in the role for some months as he challenged the result in the High Court over apparent irregularities in the election, however he was unsuccessful, with the Court recommending the allegations be instead dealt with by the M\u0101ori Council####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####'s own processes.

Software business patents dispute: In 2003, Tukaki courted controversy and widespread support, when he joined with Senator John Tierney in what was described as a battle of common sense with American company, DE Technologies. Tukaki and Senator Tierney challenged the patent holder to show cause and credibility of why they were targeting Australian companies for a percentage of the transaction value of payments made over the internet. The dispute was later resolved and is recognised as being a turning point in how software method patents are dealt with. As a result, no Australian companies or organisations were impacted by the enforcement of the patents under question. Employment and the Global Financial Crisis: At the height of the Global Financial Crisis, Tukaki was cautious in his assessment of what the impacts would be on jobs and employment, particularly####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in Australia. In 2010, he told the Sydney Morning Herald that employers were more concerned about skill shortages in some professions and that the \"usual December slowdown had failed to arrive\". This was different to a year earlier where he had told an online news service, \"The significance of underemployment is still not statistically understood and is usually where an employee may have moved from permanent work to casual or part-time work, with many moving to two part-time jobs on less salary than the previous full-time job.\" Throughout 2010 and into 2011, the cautious approach of looking at where jobs were being created and the changing dynamic of the labour market led Tukaki to become known as one of the most influential employment figures in the region. Role in suicide prevention and mental health: After joining the Board of Suicide Prevention Australia in 2010, Tukaki played an active role in the restructuring of the organisation as it developed a new strategy to halve suicide in Australia within a decade. He chaired the initial meetings that led to the formation of Australia's first coalition to undertake that task and has chaired the annual Life Awards since 2010 that acknowledge the contribution of individuals and organisations in the community who are actively working towards reducing stigma, providing support and prevention projects. In June 2014 he told Australia####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####'s Channel 9 \"It's tough out there for so many in the community and we need to take stock of whether or not we are doing all we can to support not just young people but also our older population, those in rural and remote communities because unless we start having these conversations the black dog (referring to depression) will always chase us around the room.\" In 2015 Tukaki was appointed chairman of Australia's National Coalition for Suicide Prevention. On 28 November Tukaki was elected as the chair of the Board of Suicide Prevention, replacing Murray Bleach. Tukaki has been heavily associated with business and anti-corruption, telling Radio Australia in 2012 that \"There is this false understanding that in order to win a contract in a foreign country, particularly in Asia and the subcontinent, or to do business, you somehow have to pay a bribe\". He is well known for his work when it comes to change management in both the private and public sectors as well as his view around the connection between sustainable development, business, and industry.</s>", "Matthew Tukaki is a New Zealand-born entrepreneur, business leader, and advocate for Indigenous peoples' rights.

Featherstone resided in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, where he kept 57 plastic flamingos on his back lawn. Featherstone and his wife Nancy dressed alike for over 35 years.</s><s>Biography. Featherstone was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1936 and grew up in nearby Berlin. After graduating from the Worcester Art Museum's art school, in 1957, he was offered a job designing three-dimensional animals for Union Products, Inc. Over his years at Union Products, Featherstone sculpted over 750 different items, the first two of which were a girl with a water can and a boy with a dog. When Featherstone was asked in 1957 to sculpt a duck, he purchased one, which he named Charlie, and later released the bird in Coggshall Park. Later that year, he was asked to carve a flamingo. The now iconic pink flamingo went on sale in 1958, when the color pink was popular. In 1996, Featherstone was awarded the 1996 Ig Nobel Art Prize for his creation of the pink flamingo, and he also####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### began his tenure as president of Union Products, which he held until he retired in 2000. On June 22, 2015, Featherstone died from Lewy body dementia at the age of 79. Visitors often leave pink flamingos of their own on the lawn around his grave.</s><s>Pink flamingo. Featherstone based his creation on photographs of flamingos from National Geographic, as he was not able to obtain real flamingos to use as models. As time went on, the plastic flamingo became more popular. They appeared across the country and even as parts of various art exhibits. In 1987, Donald Featherstone inscribed his signature in the original plastic mold. This was apparently to help distinguish between original and \"knock-off\" pink plastic flamingos. Featherstone's signature stayed on the bird until 2001, when it was removed. The signature was quickly replaced because of a small boycott of the unsigned birds. In November 2006, Union Products closed and production of the flamingo stopped. Shortly thereafter, a New York company purchased the molds for Featherstone's flamingos and subcontracted production to a Fitchburg company, Cado Products. In 2010, Cado Products purchased the copyrights and plastic molds for the pink flamingos and continues to manufacture them.

Her first credited and important role was as Dorothea opposite DeWolf Hopper's Don Quixote in the 1915 Fine Arts adaptation of the famous Miguel de Cervantes novel. Neil G.

He played college football for the California Golden Bears, receiving All-American honors, and was selected by the Cowboys fifth overall in the 1965 NFL Draft. Following nine seasons with the Cowboys, a quarterback controversy with Roger Staubach led to Morton joining the New York Giants for three seasons. He spent his final six seasons as a member of the Broncos, winning NFL Comeback Player of the Year and AFC Offensive Player of the Year in 1977. Morton is the first starting quarterback to appear in the Super Bowl with more than one franchise, having helped lead the Cowboys to Super Bowl V and the Broncos to Super Bowl XII. He is also the only quarterback to start for multiple franchises in their inaugural Super Bowl appearance. Morton was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1992.</s><s>Early years. Morton is a 1961 graduate of Campbell High School in Campbell, California, where he received All-state honors in football baseball and basketball. In football, he received honors as a senior. As a pitcher, Morton received offers from major league teams to play in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### their minor league systems. Morton was voted Northern California high school athlete of the year as a quarterback and was selected to play in the annual California Shrine High School football game.</s><s>College career. Morton played college football at the University of California, Berkeley, under head coach Marv Levy and assistant coach Bill Walsh, both future NFL head coaches and members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Morton became the starter in the sixth game of his sophomore season in 1962. Back then his nickname was \"Big Hummer\" and his production dominated the Golden Bears offense output. As a sophomore in 1962, he only played in the last five games because of a knee injury he suffered in practice while returning punts. He still managed 905 passing yards, a 54% completion rate and 9 touchdowns. As a junior in 1963 he already owned most of Cal's all-time quarterback records. In his three seasons as a starter at Cal, he never played on a winning team. He completed 185 of 308 passes for 2,121 yards and 13 touchdowns in his senior season in 1964, but even with a losing 3\u20137 record, he was recognized for his talent and contributions by being named first-team All-American over other winning quarterbacks. He also received the W. J. Vo####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####it Memorial Trophy, given to the best player on the Pacific Coast and the Pop Warner Trophy, given to the best senior player. In the balloting for the Heisman Trophy won by John Huarte of Notre Dame, Morton was seventh, ahead of Joe Namath of Alabama and Gale Sayers of Kansas. Morton finished his college career with 4,501 passing yards (a Pac-8 record), and most of Cal's All-time passing records, including: - Touchdown passes in one game (5) - Touchdown passes in a season (13) - Touchdown passes in a career (36) - Total yards in one game (285) - Passing yards in a career (4,501) - Passing yards in a season (2,121) - Most passing completions and attempts in one game - Most passing completions and attempts in a season - Most passing completions and attempts in one game In 1964 as the starting quarterback for the West, he faced Roger Staubach in the East\u2013West Shrine Game, which was a sign of things to come. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the Cal Athletic Hall of Fame and the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame.</s><s>Professional career.</s><s>Professional career.:Dallas Cowboys.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Morton was selected by the Dallas Cowboys fifth overall in the 1965 NFL Draft. He spent his first four seasons as the backup for Don Meredith, but still received opportunities to play due to periodic injuries suffered by Meredith. In 1969, he became the starter at quarterback over Roger Staubach, after Meredith's unexpected retirement. Morton dislocated a right finger in preseason and had to miss the season opener. In the next three games, he had a 71.1% passing percentage and was seen as having a promising future as the starter. In the fourth game against the Atlanta Falcons, he suffered a separated right shoulder after being tackled by Tommy Nobis. In the next contest against the Philadelphia Eagles, he set club records with 10 consecutive passes and 5 touchdown passes in a single game, although he sat most of the second half. He did not miss any games because of his shoulder, but his effectiveness decreased to 53.6% the rest of the season, as he caused more damage. He had surgery on his right shoulder during the offseason. In 1970, although he was bothered most of the season recuperating from his right shoulder surgery, he finished third in the NFL in passer rating with 89.8. He also led the Cowboys to Super Bowl V, where the team lost 16####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\u201313 to the Baltimore Colts. He had surgery on his right elbow during the offseason. In 1971, head coach Tom Landry created one of the most famous quarterback controversies in NFL history, when he began alternating Morton with Staubach as the starting quarterback, reaching its extreme against the Chicago Bears, where they alternated between plays. After this famous game, Landry settled on Staubach and the Cowboys went on a 10-game winning streak that included a 24\u20133 victory in Super Bowl VI over the Miami Dolphins. In 1972, Staubach suffered a separated right shoulder in the third preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams and Morton was named the starter. Although Staubach was activated in the fifth game of the season, by then Morton was entrenched at quarterback. For the first time since 1969, his arm had regained its strength, helping him register 185 completions (club record) out of 339 attempts (54.6%), 2,396 yards (fifth in the league), 15 touchdowns and 21 interceptions. He was replaced late in the third quarter of the first-round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. Staubach entered an apparently hopeless situation trailing 28\u201313 and threw two touchdown passes in the last 90 seconds to win the game 30\u201328####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, eventually sealing Morton's fate with the team. On March 18, 1974, he was selected by the Birmingham Americans in the second round (18th overall) of the WFL Pro Draft. On April 10, after repeatedly asking for a trade, Morton signed a contract with the Houston Texans of the World Football League for their 1975 season. He never played a down with them; he was traded to the New York Giants six games into the 1974 season, in exchange for their number-one draft choice in 1975 (#2-Randy White) and a second-round draft choice in 1976 (#40-Jim Jensen).</s><s>Professional career.:New York Giants. After acquiring Morton, the Giants traded their starting quarterback Norm Snead to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a third-round draft choice in 1975 and a fourth in 1976. During his time with the Giants, he struggled along with the team, and \"felt the vocal wrath of the fans.\" He was traded to the Denver Broncos in in exchange for quarterback Steve Ramsey and a fifth-round draft choice in 1978 (#137-Brian DeRoo). In his 34 career games with the Giants over three seasons, he had an 8\u201325\u20130 record, throwing for a total of 5,734 yards####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, 29 touchdowns, 49 interceptions and a 52.1 completion percentage.</s><s>Professional career.:Denver Broncos. At age 34, Morton revived his career with the Broncos, finishing the season as the second-rated passer in the AFC. Morton was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year for 1977 and selected All-AFC by the \"Sporting News\". Although he suffered in the playoffs from a swollen left hip that needed to be drained, he overcame the injury to become the first NFL quarterback to start the Super Bowl for two different teams (Dallas in V and Denver in XII), a feat only equaled by Kurt Warner, Peyton Manning, and Tom Brady. Morton is also the only quarterback to have started for two different teams' inaugural Super Bowl appearances. Unlike Warner, Manning, and Brady, however, Morton would not win a Super Bowl as a starter. He threw a franchise playoff record four interceptions in Denver's defeat against his former team, the Cowboys, which led to him being pulled in favor of Norris Weese. Morton's best statistical season came in his penultimate 17th season in 1981, when he threw for 3,195 yards and 21 touchdowns and had a 90.5 passer rating. He was a downfield passer not known for his mobility, but####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### is one of the all-time leaders in yards per completion. He briefly held the record for the most consecutive passes completed. His 8.5 yards per attempt that season remains a Broncos franchise record, as do his 54 sacks, and two games where he was sacked seven times each (later matched by Elway and Tim Tebow). Morton wore number 7 for the Broncos and retired just before the arrival of celebrated rookie John Elway in 1983, who wore the same number and in whose honor it was retired. Morton remains the third all-time passing yards leader in franchise history with 11,895 and his regular-season record was 50 wins and 28 losses in five seasons. In 1986, Morton was inducted to the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Denver Broncos' Ring of Fame in 1988.</s><s>Coaching career and later life.

Since January 2018 she has been Director, News & Current Affairs for BBC News. She was appointed in succession to James Harding. Before then she served in various senior positions in the BBC, including director of the BBC World Service Group. Previously she was acting director of News at the BBC from November 2012 until August 2013 and a member of the BBC's executive board. In 2013 she was appointed deputy director of News and Current Affairs.</s><s>Early life and education. Unsworth was born on 1957 in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. She attended St Dominic's High School, Stoke-on-Trent, a direct grant grammar school. She studied drama at the University of Manchester but was unable to get into a drama school and so switched careers to publishing in London.</s><s>BBC career. Unsworth began her broadcasting career in local radio, working at BBC Radio Leicester and BBC Radio Bristol, before going on to become producer of Radio 1's \"Newsbeat\". In 1990, she moved to Radio 4 and was based in Washington as a radio producer for the network during the Gulf crisis of 1990\u20131991. She worked as a producer on \"The World####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### at One\" and \"PM\" while at Radio 4. She moved to the BBC's Newsgathering Department in 1993, where she had responsibility for UK domestic news, and was a producer and editor for the \"BBC One O'Clock News\" and the \"BBC Six O'Clock News\". Unsworth was appointed Head of Newsgathering in January 2005. In December 2005, Unsworth appeared on the BBC's \"Newswatch\" programme, responding to accusations of double standards in BBC News reporting of racial crimes when white people were the victims. Complainants suggested the BBC buried stories such as the racist murder of Kriss Donald, with comparable murders involving black victims given twelve times more coverage and the opening of an arts centre in Gateshead reported in preference to Donald's murder. Unsworth admitted the case had not been covered sufficiently and that there had been space to do so. Her department again failed to cover the case adequately the following year. In 2011, BBC News was criticised for referring to looters in the 2011 London riots as \"protesters\", even two days into the violence. In response to 62 complaints about the matter, Unsworth conceded that the BBC had been wrong to do so. In November 2012, Unsworth was appointed acting director of News after Helen####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Boaden stepped aside while Nick Pollard prepared his report into the BBC's non-coverage of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal. She ceased working in this role in August 2013 and was appointed deputy director of News and Current Affairs. In November 2013, Unsworth was replaced as Head of Newsgathering by Jonathan Munro. In August 2014, Unsworth ordered helicopter filming of a police raid on a mansion belonging to singer Cliff Richard. The coverage led to Richard suing the BBC for breach of privacy. On 8 May 2018, \"The Guardian\" reported: \"Sir Cliff Richard is seeking a payment of at least \u00a3560,000 from the BBC following the broadcaster's coverage of a police raid at his home in 2014\". In July, Richard was awarded \u00a3210,000 in damages and the BBC agreed to pay \u00a32 million in legal costs. Unsworth apologised to Richard and stated that \"there were elements of its coverage that should have been handled differently\" but criticised the ruling as an attack on liberty and press freedoms. In January 2018, she was invited to present evidence at a parliamentary select committee meeting on gender pay gap at the BBC. This was initiated by the resignation of the then China editor Carrie Gracie in the same month over the same issue. Unsworth####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### defended the pay gap between Grace and the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel as Sopel was \"on air twice as much\" and that \"The China job [is] a more features-based agenda\". Gracie also reported that Unsworth had privately commented to a colleague that the pay gap was due to her being part-time. Unsworth denied this stating \"I did the contract, I knew she wasn't\" but apologised to her for causing a'misunderstanding' due to 'loose' language. BBC and Gracie agreed to an equal pay deal in June 2018 and she donated the back pay awarded to charity. In September 2021, it was announced that Unsworth will leave the BBC in 2022 after 40 years.</s><s>Other roles.

After losing his Commons seat to Valerie Davey in the 1997 general election, he entered the House of Lords being created a life peer as Baron Waldegrave of North Hill, \"of Chewton Mendip in the County of Somerset\", on 28 July 1999.</s><s>Private sector. Lord Waldegrave was a Director of Adam &####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Company, a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, from 2017 to 2018. He has been a Director of Coutts & Company, also a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, since 2012.

Waldegrave attended Bilderberg Group meetings four times: 1987, 1988, 1990 and 1995. In 1993, when he was the British science minister Waldegrave offered a prize for the best lay explanation of the Higgs Boson. He had observed that British taxpayers were paying a lot of money (in contributions to CERN) for something very few of them understood, and he challenged UK particle physicists to explain, in a simple manner on one piece of paper, 'What is the Higgs Boson, and why do we want to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### find it?' Professor David Miller's metaphor, which he entitled \"A quasi-political explanation of the Higgs boson\", is probably the most quoted explanation of the Higgs Boson and won the prize: - Miller asked his listeners to imagine a room full of Conservative party workers quietly talking to one another. This represents the Higgs field in space. - A former Conservative Prime Minister enters the room. All the workers she passes are strongly attracted to her. As she moves through the room, the cluster of admirers around her create resistance to her movement, and she becomes 'heavier'. This can be imagined as how a particle moves through the Higgs field. The field clusters around a particle, resisting its motion and giving it mass. - If a sleazy rumour crosses the room, it creates the same sort of clustering. The workers gather together to hear the details, the cluster can move across the room as the workers pass on the details to their neighbours. This cluster is the Higgs particle or Higgs Boson.</s><s>Further reading. - Waldegrave, William: \"A Different Kind of Weather - A Memoir\", Constable (2015);</s>", "William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill, is a British politician and member of the Conservative Party.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Alexandre Guilmant F\u00e9lix-Alexandre Guilmant (; 12 March 1837 \u2013 29 March 1911) was a French organist and composer. He was the organist of La Trinit\u00e9 from 1871 until 1901. A noted pedagogue, performer, and improviser, Guilmant helped found the Schola Cantorum de Paris. He was appointed as Professor of Organ at the Paris Conservatoire in 1896.</s><s>Biography. Guilmant was born in Meudon. A student first of his father Jean-Baptiste and later of the Belgian master Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, he became an organist and teacher in his place of birth. In 1871 he was appointed to play the organ regularly at la Trinit\u00e9 church in Paris, and this position, \"organiste titulaire\", was one he held for 30 years. Guilmant was known for his improvisations, both in the concert and church setting. His inspiration came from gregorian chants, and he was greatly noted amongst his colleagues for his mastery of the melodies. From then on, Guilmant followed a career as a virtuoso; he gave concerts in the United States (the first####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### major French organist to tour that country), and in Canada, as well as in Europe, making especially frequent visits to England. His American achievements included a 1904 series of no fewer than 40 recitals on the largest organ in the world, the St. Louis Exposition Organ, now preserved as the nucleus of Philadelphia's Wanamaker Organ. With his younger colleague Andr\u00e9 Pirro, Guilmant published a collection of scores, \"Archives des Ma\u00eetres de l'Orgue\" (Archives of the Masters of the Organ), a compilation of the compositions of numerous pre-1750 French composers. The collection was printed in ten volumes, the first in 1898 and the last (which Guilmant did not live to finalize) in 1914. Guilmant provided a rather similar survey of organ pieces by foreign composers, publishing \"l'\u00c9cole classique de l'Orgue\" (Classical School of the Organ). These anthologies, despite all the musicological developments which have taken place since Guilmant's own time, remain very valuable sources of early music. In 1894 Guilmant founded the Schola Cantorum with Charles Bordes and Vincent d'Indy. He taught there####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### up until his death at his home in Meudon, near Paris, in 1911. In addition, he taught at the Conservatoire de Paris where he succeeded Charles-Marie Widor as organ teacher in 1896. As a teacher, Guilmant was noted for his kindness and attention to detail. His students' recollections feature accounts of a particular focus on all facets of a note: attack, release, character. Marcel Dupr\u00e9 was the most celebrated of his many students. Others included Augustin Bari\u00e9, Joseph-Arthur Bernier, Joseph Bonnet, Alexandre Eug\u00e8ne Cellier, Abel Decaux, Gabriel Dupont, Charles Henry Galloway, Philip Hale, Edgar Henrichsen, \u00c9douard Mignan, and \u00c9mile Poillot. Guilmant's interest in Marcel Dupr\u00e9 began when the latter was a child. Albert Dupr\u00e9, father of the celebrated Marcel, studied organ with Guilmant for seven years prior to his son's birth. In Dupr\u00e9's memoirs, he includes an anecdote where Guilmant visits his mother upon his birth and declares that the child will grow up to be an organist. After frequent visits throughout his childhood, Marcel Dupr\u00e9 began studying with Guil####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####mant formally at age 11. From this time until his death, Guilmant championed the young virtuoso and did much to advance his career. Guilmant's house was later purchased then demolished by Dupr\u00e9 and rebuilt. His home organ was also sold to Dupr\u00e9.</s><s>Compositions. Guilmant was an accomplished and extremely prolific composer. Unlike Widor, who produced a great deal of music in all the main genres, Guilmant devoted himself almost entirely to works for his own instrument, the organ. His organ output includes: 'Pi\u00e8ces dans diff\u00e9rents styles', published in 18 books; 'L'organiste pratique', published in 12 books; Eighteen 'Pi\u00e8ces Nouvelles'; and 'L'Organiste liturgique', published in 10 books. Guilmant's Eight Sonatas were conceived with the Cavaill\u00e9-Coll organ of La Trinit\u00e9 in mind, and are therefore symphonic in style and form, taking their place alongside the symphonic organ works of C\u00e9sar Franck and the Organ Symphonies of Charles-Marie Widor. The Sonate No. 1/Symphonie No. 1 for####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### organ and orchestra, Op. 42, was programmed by Sergei Koussevitzky in the 1930s, but was not heard again until Igor Buketoff revived it for a 1977 live recording with the Butler University Orchestra (note, the composer's name is misspelled \"Gilmont\" in the source). Though few in number, his works for instruments besides the organ have not been entirely neglected. For example, the Morceau Symphonique is one of the most frequently performed trombone solos, enjoying longstanding popularity among both professional and advanced student trombonists.</s>", "Alexandre Guilmant was a French organist and composer born on March 12, 1837, in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. He began studying music at a young age with his father, and later studied at the Paris Conservatory with Francois Benoist and Jacques Lemmens. Guilmant is best known for his contributions to the organ repertoire, including his numerous organ symphonies, sonatas, and pieces. He was also a renowned performer and toured extensively throughout Europe and the United States, performing on many of the world's greatest organs.

He was Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer under Michael Howard and Shadow Home Secretary under Iain Duncan Smith. He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 2014 to 2016. Following the 2015 general election Letwin was given overall responsibility for the Cabinet Office and became a full member of the Cabinet in the Conservative government. Previously he had been the Minister of State for Government Policy from 2010. During the Second May ministry in 2019, Letwin rebelled against leading Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party by tabling a cross-party motion to hold \"indicative votes\", allowing MPs to vote on several Brexit options in order to establish whether any could command a majority in the House of Commons; it transpired that none of them could. Letwin sought to extend Article 50 through passing the Cooper\u2013Letwin Act. In August 2019 he announced that he would stand down at the next election. On 3 September 2019, he lost the Conservative party whip and sat as an independent MP####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### after that.</s><s>Early life and education. Letwin, who was born 19 May 1956 in London, is the son of William Letwin (14 December 1922 \u2013 20 February 2013), emeritus professor at the London School of Economics, and the conservative academic Shirley Robin Letwin. His parents were \"Jewish-American intellectuals from Chicago whose parents had fled persecution in Kyiv.\" He was educated at The Hall School, Hampstead and at Eton College. He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received a double first in history. From 1980 to 1981, Letwin was a visiting fellow (a Procter Fellow) of Princeton University, then a research fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge, from 1981 until 1982. His thesis, \"Emotion and Emotions\", earned a PhD awarded by the Cambridge Philosophy Faculty in 1982. He is also a graduate of the London Business School.</s><s>Political career. He was a member of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Policy Unit from 1983 to 1986. According to official government documents from 1985, released in December 2014 under the thirty-year rule, Letwin recommended that the Prime Minister \"use Scotland as a trail-blazer for the pure residence charge\", i.e. the controversial Community Charge or \"Poll tax\",####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### having trialled it there first, and to implement it nationwide should \"the exemplifications prove... it is feasible.\" Another 1985 internal memo released in December 2015 showed Letwin's response to the Broadwater Farm riot, which blamed the violence on the \"bad moral attitudes\" of the predominantly Afro-Caribbean rioters, claiming that \"lower-class, unemployed white people lived for years without a breakdown of public order on anything like the present scale\". It also criticised some of the schemes proposed to address inner-city problems, suggesting David Young's proposed scheme to support black entrepreneurs would flounder because the money would be spent on the \"disco and drug trade\". Letwin later apologised, saying that parts of the memo had been \"both badly worded and wrong.\" Letwin co-authored \"Britain's biggest enterprise: ideas for radical reform of the NHS\", a 1988 Centre for Policy Studies pamphlet written with John Redwood which advocated a closer relationship between the National Health Service and the private sector. This is regarded as providing a theoretical justification for NHS reforms carried out by subsequent governments, particularly the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Letwin stood unsuccessfully against Diane Abbott in Hackney North and Stoke Newington at the 1987 election, and against Glenda Jackson for the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Hampstead and Highgate seat at the 1992 election.</s><s>Political career.:MP for West Dorset (1997\u20132019). Letwin won the historically safe Conservative seat of West Dorset at the 1997 general election, achieving a majority of 1,840 votes over the next candidate.</s><s>Political career.:MP for West Dorset (1997\u20132019).:Shadow Cabinet (2000\u20132010). As Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Conservative Party William Hague appointed Letwin as a member of his Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury in September 2000. He supported Michael Portillo and Michael Howard in their consecutive tenures as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. He had previously been an official Opposition spokesman on Constitutional Affairs, Scotland and Wales from 1998, and was promoted to Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury in 1999. During the campaign for the 2001 general election, Letwin expressed an aspiration to curtail future public spending by \u00a320\u00a0billion per annum relative to the plans of the Labour government. When this proposal came under attack as regressive, Letwin found few of his colleagues to defend it, and he adopted a low profile for the remainder of the campaign. He went into hiding during the 2001 election. At this election, his majority in his West D####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####orset constituency was cut to 1,414 votes. In September 2001, he was appointed Shadow Home Secretary by the new Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith. In this role, he attracted plaudits for his advocacy of a \"neighbourly society\", which manifested itself in calls for street by street neighbourhood policing, modelled on the philosophy of the police in New York. He was also largely credited with forcing the then Home Secretary to withdraw his proposal in 2001 to introduce an offence of incitement to religious hatred. He successfully argued that such an offence would be impossible to define, so there would be little chance of prosecution. He also argued that Muslims would feel persecuted by such a law. In late 2003, Michael Howard appointed Letwin as his successor as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. As Shadow Chancellor he focused on reducing waste in the public sector. At the 2005 general election the Conservative Party claimed to have found \u00a335\u00a0billion worth of potential savings, to be used for increased resources for front-line services and for tax cuts. This approach was credited with forcing the government to introduce bureaucracy reduction and cost-cutting proposals of their own. In May 2005, Letwin's majority in his seat increased to 2,461 votes, despite his hard pro-EU views####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. After the election, Letwin was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. \"The Times\" reported that he had requested a role less onerous than his former Treasury brief so that he would have time to pursue his career in the City. Until December 2009, he was a non-executive director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild Corporate Finance Ltd. Following Michael Howard's decision to stand down as Conservative Party leader after the 2005 election, Letwin publicly backed the youngest candidate and eventual winner David Cameron. In the lead-up to the 2010 general election, Letwin played an important role in the development of Conservative policy, and was described by Daniel Finkelstein as \"the Gandalf of the process\". The 2010 general election saw him increase his majority to 3,923 votes.</s><s>Political career.:MP for West Dorset (1997\u20132019).:Cameron premiership (2010\u20132016). British Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Letwin to the newly-created office of Minister of State for Government Policy in the newly-formed Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition government in May 2010. His responsibilities included developing government policies with the Cabinet Office, as set out in the Coalition's programme for government, as well as implementing departmental business plans.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### He also attended the Cabinet, although not as a full member or Cabinet Minister. Letwin was appointed as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 14 July 2014, succeeding Lord Hill of Oareford who became the United Kingdom's next European Commissioner. He also continued in his role as Minister for Policy until the 2015 general election, when the position was abolished. He was returned with a much increased majority of 16,130 votes by his West Dorset constituents at the 2015 general election. Following that election, Letwin remained Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Cameron also appointed him as a full member of the new Conservative government's Cabinet with responsibility for overall charge and oversight of the Cabinet Office. Immediately after the 23 June 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Cameron appointed Letwin \"Minister for Brexit\". He appeared on 5 July before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and was criticised for Government's lack of planning for a leave vote. Cabinet was accused of \"dereliction of duty\". When committee chairman Crispin Blunt observed upon the resignation of Cameron that Letwin had been left \"holding the baby\", Letwin said, \"I can only say that the baby is being firmly held, and that my intention is that the baby should prosper \u2013 because I care about####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the baby in question. It is, in fact, our country.\" Letwin was awarded a knighthood by David Cameron in the 2016 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours List. This gave him the honorific title \"Sir\" for life.</s><s>Political career.:MP for West Dorset (1997\u20132019).:May premiership (2016\u20132019). The new Prime Minister Theresa May terminated Letwin's tenure as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and split the Minister for Brexit position he had held, creating the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union and handing that job to arch-Leaver David Davis. In 2018, Letwin led an \"independent review\" into the delivery of housing on large development sites. During the Second May ministry in 2019, Letwin rebelled against leading Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party by tabling a cross-party motion to hold \"indicative votes\", allowing MPs to vote on several Brexit options in order to establish whether any could command a majority in the House of Commons. Though no option received a positive number of votes, the \"People's Vote\" proposal from Margaret Beckett was the most popular.</s><s>Political career.:MP for West Dorset (1997\u20132019).:Expulsion from####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Conservative Party. In August 2019, Letwin announced that he would stand down at the next general election. On 3 September 2019 he proposed the Letwin motion upon the Benn bill under Standing Order No. 24, and then, with 20 other rebel Conservative MPs, voted against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson. The rebel MPs voted for the Letwin motion to take control of parliamentary business from the government, for the purpose of introducing a bill which would prevent the Prime Minister's policy of allowing the United Kingdom to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October. The bill thus introduced the next day became the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. Subsequently, all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative whip, expelling them as Conservative MPs and requiring them to sit as independents. If Letwin had decided to stand for re-election in a future election the party would have blocked him as a Conservative candidate, but that was immaterial for him, as he had already promised in August to stand down.</s><s>Political career.:MP for West Dorset (1997\u20132019).:As an independent MP.

His amendment attracted the support of ten former Conservative and ten Democratic Unionist Party members, while the government attracted the votes of six Labour MPs and seventeen independents. Eight Labour MPs, five Conservatives and one independent member did not vote on the Letwin motion. The following day, \"The Sunday Telegraph\" published a declaration from an anonymous Conservative source that Letwin's motion had been masterminded by Lord Pannick, the barrister who had represented Gina Miller in her actions against the Johnson ministry's Brexit policy. After announcing that he would not stand in the 2019 general election, Letwin was succeeded as the Conservative candidate for Dorset West by Chris Loder, who was subsequently elected as the seat's MP.</s><s>Public sector spending. Letwin maintained in June 2017 that the public is willing to increase taxes carefully for large numbers of people to pay for improved public services. Letwin said, \"It may well be, in one way or another, a large number of people will have to pay a little more tax if we are going to maintain the trend towards reduced deficits####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and yet spend a little more on the crucial public services that do need more spent on them\". Letwin wants to see better public services rather than higher public sector pay. Letwin believes reducing the deficit is important so Britain is protected when the next downturn comes.</s><s>Controversies.</s><s>Controversies.:1985 Broadwater Farm memo controversy. In 1985, Letwin and Hartley Booth wrote a five-page document as members of then-Prime Minister Thatcher's policy unit in response to the widespread 1985 unrest in Britain's inner cities \u2013 with riots in Broadwater Farm estates in Tottenham, North London, Handsworth, Brixton, Peckham and Toxteth. In the paper, Letwin and Booth urged \"Thatcher to ignore reports that rioting in mainly black urban areas was the result of social deprivation and racism.\" Letwin was at the time considered to be a \"young star\" of the Conservative Party. The memo scorned suggestions by senior cabinet ministers to set up a \u00a310\u00a0million communities programme to tackle inner-city problems by helping black entrepreneurs start businesses as suggested by then-Employment Secretary David Young, refurbishing public housing council blocks as suggested by then-Environment Secretary Kenneth Baker and \"establishing training programmes for low-income youth.\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Letwin said it would not ameliorate the situation but would do little more than \"subsidise Rastafarian arts and crafts workshops\" stating that black \"entrepreneurs will set up in the disco and drug trade.\" When the 1985 paper was released to public record by the Cabinet Office along with other Whitehall papers under accelerated procedures of the 30 years rule into the public record through the National Archives in Kew, West London on 30 December 2015, a chastened Letwin apologised on the same day for \"the offence caused\". Trevor Phillips OBE, former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission observed that, \"I don't think these remarks would have raised a single eyebrow at the time.\" The 1985 Broadwater Farm memo argued the riots were caused by bad behaviour not social conditions. The policy unit proposed a programme for creating \"better attitudes,\" including measures to encourage the establishment of 'old-fashioned independent schools' which Cabinet Secretary Sir Robert Armstrong warned in 1985 constituted social engineering. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, whose Streatham constituency included parts of Brixton, said the tone of the memo was \"positively Victorian.\" He added: The attitudes towards the black community exhibited in the paper are disgusting and appalling... The authors of this paper illustrate####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a complete ignorance of what was going on in our community at that time, as evidenced by their total and utter disregard of the rampant racism in the Met Police which caused the community to boil over \u2013 there is no mention of that racism in their paper. In July 2014 the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, apologised \"unreservedly\" for the shooting and the time it had taken to say sorry\" following an inquest into the death of Dorothy \"Cherry\" Groce, whose shooting by the Metropolitan Police triggered the riots. The jury inquest blamed the Metropolitan Police for failures that contributed to Groce's death.</s><s>Controversies.:Asylum seekers. In 2003, while Shadow Home Secretary, Letwin announced a policy to prevent any asylum seekers entering the UK instead suggesting a \"far off-shore processing centre\". When questioned about where this processing centre would be, he said \"I haven't the slightest idea yet.\". He had previously suggested holding asylum seekers on prison ships for vetting by security services.</s><s>Controversies.:Expenses. \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported in 2009 that Letwin agreed to repay a bill for \u00a32,145 for replacing a leaking pipe under the tennis court at his constituency home in Dorset, which he####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### had claimed on his parliamentary expenses.</s><s>Controversies.:Public sector reform. Speaking to consultancy firm KPMG on 27 July 2011, Letwin caused controversy after stating that you cannot have \"innovation and excellence\" without \"real discipline and some fear on the part of the providers\" in the public sector. This was widely reported, with \"The Guardian\" headline stating Letwin says \"public sector workers need 'discipline and fear'.\"</s><s>Controversies.:Government document disposal. In October 2011 the \"Daily Mirror\" reported a story that Letwin had thrown away more than 100 secret government documents in public bins in St. James's Park, with no real care to dispose of them properly. Enquiries made by the Information Commissioner's Office found that although Letwin did not dispose of any government documents, he had in fact disposed of constituents' personal and confidential letters to him and therefore did breach data protection rules. Letwin later apologised for his actions.</s><s>Personal life. Letwin married government lawyer Isabel Davidson in 1984; the couple have two children. In 2003, \"The Independent\" reported Letwin saying that he would \"go out on the streets and beg\" rather than send his children to the state schools in Lambeth where he and his####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### family lived.</s><s>Honours. - He was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council in 2002. This gave him the Honorific Title \"The Right Honourable\" for Life. - He was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II after being recommended by David Cameron in the 2016 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours List.

On 16 December 2005, after a disappointing 2\u20132 draw against Iraklis, Malesani held a roaring press conference. Tired of the criticisms he and Panathinaikos had received for some poor performances both from press and supporters, he defended his hard work and dedication, as well as the club's owner Giannis Vardinogiannis, in front of the journalists.</s><s>Controversy.:Siena. On 9 January 2010, after losing 4-3 a dramatic match at San Siro stadium against the Inter team which went on winning the treble, Malesani contested the foul leading to the free-kick Inter scored for the temporary 3-3. In particular, Malesani claimed that small teams have no protection in Serie A and big teams take advantage of that. On 24 January 2010, after a 1\u20131 home draw against Cagliari, Siena President Massimo Mezzaroma declared his disappointment for the team performances in front of TV journalists. Following this statement####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, RAI host Enrico Varriale welcomed Malesani in the post-match interview calling him \"allenatore che sta un po' sulla graticola\" (Italian for \"manager risking his job\") and anticipated that Mezzaroma would have phoned him later. Malesani was left surprised and deeply embittered, especially because the discussion had immediately focused on off-the-pitch topics. He then reminded that Mezzaroma had said good things about him and that he was doing everything he could for the team, underlining the upsides of the draw.</s><s>Controversy.:Genoa. On 1 December 2011, Malesani got very annoyed by the journalists calling him \"mollo\" (Italian for \"limp\"). Consequently, he focused his press conference on proving his motivation and skills.</s><s>Managerial statistics.</s><s>Honours.</s><s>Honours.:Managerial. - Chievo (1993\u20131997) - Serie C1: 1993\u201394 - Parma (1998\u20132001) - Coppa Italia: 1998\u201399 - UEFA Cup: 1998\u201399 - Supercoppa Italiana: 1999</s><s>See also. - List of UEFA Cup winning managers</s>", "Alberto Malesani is an Italian former footballer and football manager.

Kisser was born in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, a municipality in S\u00e3o Paulo to a Slovene mother, from Maribor, Slovenia, and a German father. His father was a mechanical engineer and his mother was a teacher and amateur artist. At an early age, Kisser showed an interest in music. He was 10 when he started to listen to his parents' records of the Beatles, Roberto Carlos and Tonico & Tinoco. He received his first acoustic guitar from his grandmother and later won a second guitar at a game of Bingo. In his early adolescence, Kisser started to play acoustic guitar first learning basic chords from the Brazilian popular music repertoire and later on classical pieces. A friend then introduced Kisser to hard rock with bands like Queen and Kiss which had a great####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### influence on him. In 1983, he went to see Kiss live in S\u00e3o Paulo and his father took him to Rock In Rio in 1985 to see AC/DC.

Following the departure of original lead guitarist Jairo Guedes, Kisser auditioned for the position of lead guitarist.

For Arise and thereafter Kisser began to write songs of his own. Kisser has also occasionally provided backing vocals both live and on the records.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Ramesses IV Usermaatre Heqamaatre Setepenamun Ramesses IV (also written Ramses or Rameses) was the third pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. He was the second son of Ramesses III and became crown prince when his elder brother Amenherkhepshef died aged 15 in 1164 BC, when Ramesses was only 12 years old. His promotion to crown prince: is suggested by his appearance (suitably entitled) in a scene of the festival of Min at the Ramesses III temple at Karnak, which may have been completed by Year 22 [of his father's reign]. (the date is mentioned in the poem inscribed there) As his father's chosen successor, the prince employed three distinctive titles: \"Hereditary Prince\", \"Royal scribe\" and \"Generalissimo.\" The latter two titles are mentioned in a text at the temple of Amenhotep III at Soleb and all three titles appear on a lintel now in Florence, Italy. As heir-apparent he took on increasing responsibilities; for instance, in Year 27 of his father's reign, he is depicted appointing a certain Amenemope to the important position of Third Prophet of Am####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####un in the latter's TT 148 tomb. Amenemope's Theban tomb also accords prince Ramesses all three of his aforementioned sets of royal titles. Despite the 31-year reign of his father Ramesses III, Ramesses IV was only 21 when he became pharaoh. His rule has been dated to 1155 to 1149 BC.</s><s>Family. It is now believed that Ramesses IV's mother was most likely Queen Tyti from recently discovered notes published in the 2010 issue of the \"Journal of Egyptian Archaeology\". They reveal that Tyti\u2014who was a king's daughter, a king's wife and a king's mother in her own right\u2014was identified in Papyrus BM EA 10052 (i.e., the tomb-robbery papyri) to be a queen of Ramesses III, Ramesses IV's father. The 2010 JEA article authors\u2014including Aidan Dodson\u2014write that since Ramesses VI's mother is known to be a certain lady named Iset Ta-Hemdjert or Isis: only Ramesses IV and Ramesses VIII remain as candidates [for the son of Tyti]. Given that Ramesses VIII only reigned briefly some 25 years after his father\u2019s death, it is hardly likely####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### that the decoration of QV52, with the \"mwt-nsw\" (i.e., king's mother) title intimately mixed with Tyti\u2019s other titles, could have been delayed this late to refer to him. This leaves Ramesses IV as the only credible primary'subject' of the \"mwt-nsw\" title in the tomb. As for which--if any--of the other sons of Ramesses III were borne to Tyti, no unequivocal data is available, other than the fact that Amenhirkhopeshef B, buried in QV55, was \"ms n Hmt-nTr mwt-nTr Hmt-nsw-wrt\", paralleling Tyti's titles so closely that he may with some confidence be proposed as her son. Thus, the identity of Ramesses IV's mother has been resolved in favour of Queen Tyti who was once erroneously thought to be the mother of another king in the mid-1980s: Ramesses XI. Ramesses IV was succeeded to the throne by his 13-year-old son Ramesses V.</s><s>Projects. Ramesses IV came to the throne in difficult circumstances. Ramesses III, his father, was assassinated by####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### conspirators led by Tiye, one of his secondary wives, to establish Pentawer, her own son and Ramesses IV's half-brother, on the throne. Ramesses IV, however, was able to secure himself on the throne, and had the conspirators arrested and executed. At the start of his reign, the pharaoh initiated a substantial building program on the scale of Ramesses II by doubling the size of the work gangs at Deir el-Medina to a total of 120 men and dispatching numerous expeditions to the stone quarries of Wadi Hammamat and the turquoise mines of the Sinai. The Great Rock stela of Ramesses IV at Wadi Hammamat records that the largest expedition\u2014dated to his Year 3, third month of Shemu day 27\u2014consisted of 8,368 men alone including 5,000 soldiers, 2,000 personnel of the Amun temples, 800 Apiru and 130 stonemasons and quarrymen under the personal command of the High Priest of Amun, Ramessesnakht. The scribes who composed the text also noted that this figure included 900 men \"\"who are dead and omitted from this list.\"\" Consequently, once this omitted figure is included to the tally of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 8,368 men who served in the Year 3 quarry expedition, a total of 900 men out of an original expedition of 8,368 men perished during this endeavour for a mortality rate of 10.7%. Some of the stones which were dragged 60 miles to the Nile from Wadi Hammamat weighed 40 tons or more. Other Egyptian quarries including Aswan were located much closer to the Nile which enabled them to use barges to transport stones long distances. Part of the king's program included the extensive enlargement of his father's Temple of Khonsu at Karnak and the construction of a large mortuary temple near the Temple of Hatshepsut. Ramesses IV also sent several expeditions to the turquoise mines in the Sinai; a total of four expeditions are known prior to his fourth year. The Serabit el-Khadim stela of the Royal Butler Sobekhotep states: \"Year 3, third month of Shemu. His Majesty sent his favoured and beloved one, the confident of his lord, the Overseer of the Treasury of Silver and Gold, Chief of the Secrets of the august Palace, Sobekhotep, justified, to bring for him all that his heart desired of turquoise (on) \"his####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### fourth expedition\".\" This expedition dates to either Ramesses III or IV's reign since Sobekhotep is attested in office until at least the reign of Ramesses V. Ramesses IV's final venture to the turquoise mines of the Sinai is documented by the stela of a senior army scribe named Panufer. Panufer states that this expedition's mission was both to procure turquoise and to establish a cult chapel of king Ramesses IV at the Hathor temple of Serabit el-Khadim. The stela reads: Year 5, second month of Shomu [i.e., summer]. The sending by His Majesty \u00ab/nowiki>to build the Mansion of Millions of Years of Ramesses IV in the temple of Hathor, Lady of Turquoise, by Panefer, the Scribe of the Commands of the Army, son of Pairy, justified. While little is known regarding the route that the mining missions took from Egypt to Serabit el-Khadim, A. J. Peden, who wrote a biography of Ramesses IV in 1994, states that there were \"two obvious routes\" to reach this site: The first was a straightforward march from a Delta base, such as Memphis,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### east south-east and then south into Sinai. Surviving a march in this inhospitable land would have presented formidable logistical obstacles, perhaps forcing an alternative route to be adopted. This would involve a departure from the Delta to a site near the modern port of Suez. From here they could have proceeded by boat to the ports of Abu Zenima or El-Markha on the west coast of the Sinai peninsula and from there it is a short journey inland of only a day or two to the actual site of Serabit el-Khadim.</s><s>Attestations. Ramesses IV is attested by his aforementioned building activity at Wadi Hammamat and Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai as well as several papyri and even one obelisk. The creation of a royal cult in the Temple of Hathor is known under his reign at Serabit el-Khadim while Papyrus Mallet (or P. Louvre 1050) dates to Years 3 and 4 of his reign. Papyrus Mallet is a six column text dealing partly with agricultural affairs; its first column lists the prices for various commodities between Year 31 of Ramesses III until Year 3 of Ramesses IV. The final four columns contain a memorandum of 2 letters####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### composed by the Superintendent of Cattle of the Estate of Amen-Re, Bakenkhons, to several mid-level administrators and their subordinates. Meanwhile, surviving monuments of Ramesses IV in the Delta consists of an obelisk recovered in Cairo and a pair of his cartouches found on a pylon gateway both originally from Heliopolis. The most important document to survive from this pharaoh's rule is Papyrus Harris I, which honours the life of his father, Ramesses III, by listing the latter's many accomplishments and gifts to the temples of Egypt, and the Turin papyrus, the earliest known geologic map. Ramesses IV was perhaps the last New Kingdom king to engage in large-scale monumental building after his father as \"\"there was a marked decline in temple building even during the longer reigns of Ramesses IX and VI. The only apparent exception was the attempt of Ramesses V and VI to continue the vast and uncompleted mortuary temple of Ramesses IV at the Assasif.\"\"</s><s>Death. Despite Ramesses IV's many endeavours for the gods and his prayer to Osiris\u2014preserved on a Year 4 stela at Abydos\u2014that \"thou shalt give me the great age with a long reign####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### [as my predecessor]\", the king did not live long enough to accomplish his ambitious goals. After a short reign of about six and a half years, Ramesses IV died and was buried in tomb KV2 in the Valley of the Kings. His mummy was found in the royal cache of Amenhotep II's tomb KV35 in 1898. His chief wife is Queen Duatentopet or Tentopet or who was buried in QV74. His son, Ramesses V, would succeed him to the throne. Originally, Ramesses IV had a tomb built for him in the Valley of the Queens, QV53. In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs' Golden Parade.</s><s>Further reading. - Gabriella Dembitz, Les inscriptions de Rams\u00e8s IV de l'all\u00e9e processionnelle nord-sud \u00e0 Karnak r\u00e9vis\u00e9es.

He began building his own amplifiers and would buy transformers from Tubby's Dromilly Road studio. While at the studio, Scientist asked Tubby to give him a chance at mixing. He was taken on at Tubby's as an assistant, performing tasks such as winding transformer coils, and began working as a mixer in the mid-1970s, initially creating dubs of reworked Studio One tracks for Don Mais's Roots Tradition label, given his chance when Prince Jammy cut short a mixing session for Mais because he was too tired to continue.

At the age of 37, he was the youngest person to occupy this office in more than five decades. Lousteau served as the Argentine Ambassador to the United States from 2015 to 2017. In 2017, Lousteau joined the UCR but was not part of Cambiemos in Argentine Congress. From 2013 to 2019, he was a National Deputy, representing Buenos Aires. He resigned his bench at the Chamber of Deputies to be sworn in as Senator on 10 December 2019.</s><s>Early career. Lousteau was born in Buenos Aires. He graduated from Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. He is a Licentiate in Economics (graduated \"summa cum laude\" from the Universidad de San Andr\u00e9s), and a Master of Science in Economics (at the London School of Economics). He taught as a postgraduate professor at the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, and as graduate professor at the Universidad####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### de San Andr\u00e9s. He is the author of \"Sin Atajos\" (\"No Shortcuts\", 2005), a history of Argentina's economic crises, with Javier Gonz\u00e1lez Fraga; and \"Hacia un Federalismo Solidario\" (\"Towards a Cooperative Federalism\"), as well as specialized works and journalistic articles that have been published in Argentina and abroad. Lousteau had also been a tennis instructor (which he quit because of an injury), and worked as a war correspondent in Afghanistan for the magazines \"El Planeta Urbano\" and \"La Raz\u00f3n\" before the September 11 attacks. Lousteau served as chief economist and later director of APL Econom\u00eda, a consulting firm founded by former Central Bank President Alfonso Prat-Gay, and went on to hold various public offices as well as positions in the private sector. He was appointed Adviser to the President of the Central Bank of Argentina in 2003, for whom he designed a bank matching scheme for the payment of the discount window loans; and served in the Central Bank's Committee on Monetary Policy until 2004). He was appointed by Governor Felipe Sol\u00e1 as Minister of Production of Buenos Aires Province in 2005, and late that year was named Chairman of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and of its parent company, the BAPRO Group, where he served from 2005 until his designation as Economy Minister in December 2007. He later co-founded a business consulting firm, LCG, with Gast\u00f3n Rossi.</s><s>Minister of Economy. Lousteau was the first minister of economy of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. There was a dispute in the cabinet at the time between Julio de Vido, Ricardo Jaime and Guillermo Moreno, and Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, Graciela Oca\u00f1a, Jorge Taiana and Carlos Tomada. Lousteau sided with Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, as he did not share the economic views of De Vido and Moreno. Fern\u00e1ndez had promised him that both of them would be removed from government in a short time. Lousteau wrote a report for the president on the figures of the national economy, praising several aspects of the tenure of N\u00e9stor Kirchner, but warning about the growing inflation. This report was dismissed by N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who did not have an actual office but remained an influential figure. He also proposed to gradually reduce the subsidies to energy consumption, to eventually abandon the fixed price system established during the 2001 crisis.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Cristina Kirchner did not support his proposal. The salient feature of his tenure was the controversy surrounding his decision to increase soybean export taxes, which were previously fixed at 35%, and to have them fluctuate in line with global prices for the crop. This has been claimed as the major cause of the protests in the Argentine countryside which took place in early 2008. Lousteau was heavily involved in talks with farmers' leaders but was later sidelined. Lousteau was rumored as early as two months into his tenure to have declared his intention to resign as a result of disputes with fellow ministers, particularly Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno. He denied he would resign; but there was nevertheless continued speculation on his resignation or replacement in the wake of the agrarian crisis. Lousteau resigned on 24 April 2008, with the tax agency chief Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez replacing him. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", his brief tenure was clouded from the outset by interference from former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner's allies. Lousteau's policy initiatives often seemed to be eclipsed by those of Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno, a Kirchner loyalist described as \"the administration's price policeman.\"</s><s>Later work. Following his dismissal Louste####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####au contributed a weekly opinion column for the conservative daily \"La Naci\u00f3n\" and published two best-selling books on economic theory and history, \"Econom\u00eda 3-D\" (2011) and \"Otra vuelta a la econom\u00eda\" (2012). He received a Yale World Fellowship in 2012.</s><s>Politics in Buenos Aires. Lousteau joined the UNEN coalition, led by the centrist UCR, and was nominated to their City of Buenos Aires party list for Congress in the 2013 mid-term elections. He was one of five UNEN candidates elected to Congress for the City of Buenos Aires; but ongoing differences with caucus leader Elisa Carri\u00f3 led Lousteau to form his own faction (Suma + UNEN), joined by UNEN Congressmen relying in grassroots action in the UCR. He ran for mayor in 2015 backed by centre-left coalition called ECO (\"Energ\u00eda Ciudadana Organizada\"), and was narrowly defeated by Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta. In these elections, PRO was stronger in wealthier northern Buenos Aires, while ECO was stronger in the southern, poorer neighborhoods of the city. He was appointed ambassador of Argentina to the United States by president Mauricio Macri in 2016, but####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### he resigned the following year to run for National Deputy in the 2017 Argentine mid-term elections.

She was born and brought up in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, as the youngest child of the family, with two elder brothers Jonathan and David, whilst becoming fluent in the Tamil language. Despite her mixed background, she has cited herself as a Tamilian. As a part of her education, Samantha was school####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ed at Holy Angels Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School and then completed a degree in commerce at Stella Maris College, Chennai. Towards the end of her undergraduate degree she became involved in modelling, notably working with Naidu Hall, through which she was first spotted by filmmaker Ravi Varman.</s><s>Career.</s><s>Career.:Debut, breakthrough and critical acclaim (2010-2012). Samantha began her professional film career with Gautham Vasudev Menon's Telugu film, \"Ye Maaya Chesave\" (2010). The film, simultaneously made in Tamil as \"Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa\" (2010), was highly anticipated prior to release, primarily due to the first-time-collaboration between Gautham Menon and composer A. R. Rahman. The actress successfully auditioned and was signed up for the project in August 2009. The film was shot in India and the United States, and it released on 26 February 2010. Post-release, she revealed that Menon played a \"crucial part in moulding her as an actress\", teaching her how to remain natural and comfortable in front of the screen, even if she had no dialogues in a scene. In the film, Samantha played the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### lead character Jessie, a Malayali Saint Thomas Christian girl living in Hyderabad, with whom the male protagonist, played by Naga Chaitanya, falls in love. Upon release of the film, Samantha received highly positive reviews for her portrayal, with the film itself garnering widespread critical acclaim. Critics at Sify praised Samantha as a \"scene-stealer\" and her beauty as \"alluring\", adding, \"she was the girl to watch out for.\" Jeevi from Idlebrain.com, wrote that \"Samantha's debut is one of the best heroine debuts in Telugu cinema\" and noted that the \"minute expressions she gave spoke volumes about her\", whilst labelling the film as a \"classic\". Her performance in \"Ye Maaya Chesave\" earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress \u2013 Telugu and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut \u2013 South and the Nandi Special Jury Award. Samantha appeared in a cameo role in the Tamil version of the film, portraying an assistant director who becomes an actress. Both the Telugu and the Tamil versions of the films proved to be major successes, propelling Samantha to stardom. She followed up her collaborations with Gautham Menon and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### A. R. Rahman by appearing in the music video for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 promotional song, \"Semmozhiyaana Thamizh Mozhiyaam\", which Menon directed and Rahman composed. Samantha's next release was the romantic drama, \"Baana Kaathadi\" (2010), opposite Adharvaa. The film was actually the third Tamil project signed by the actress, but its release preceded the first two that she was contracted for due to delays in their completion. Samantha portrayed a student of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), the first such role in Tamil cinema. Her next release was Ravi Varman's \"Moscowin Kavery\" (2010), originally the first film she began work on. The shooting for the film began in August 2007, with Samantha, then briefly credited with the screen name Yasodha, joining the team later in the year. In an interview held in 2008, Ravi Varman mentioned that he had decided that Samantha would be the lead actress for his film within three minutes after viewing one of her commercial assignments. He went on to describe her as an actress with \"intelligence\" and \"potential\", whilst drawing comparisons with the noted actress, Revathi. However, due to Ravi####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Varman's prior commitments as cinematographer in other projects, the film languished in development hell, eventually releasing in August 2010. The film earned negative reviews from critics, though Samantha's performance was credited as one of the sole highlights that the film offered. In August 2008, while still completing her last three projects, Samantha also signed up to play the lead role of a modern girl in the Narain-starrer, \"Pookada Ravi\", which was later shelved. Samantha then went on to feature in Vamsi Paidipally's Telugu film \"Brindaavanam\" (2010) in which she played a supporting role alongside NTR Jr and Kajal Aggarwal. Her performance as Indu was well-received despite having a shorter screen time, and the film became her second successful venture in Telugu. Samantha featured in the big-budget Telugu film, \"Dookudu\" (2012) alongside Mahesh Babu, which became one of the most successful Telugu films of all time. The film received positive reviews, with a critic from \"The Times of India\" stating \"Samantha looks beautiful and has done a great job, though her role as Prashanthi isn't too lengthy.\" She####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress \u2013 Telugu for her performance in the film. She also subsequently made guest appearances in two of Gautham Vasudev Menon's films, first in the psychological thriller film, \"Nadunisi Naaygal\" (2011) as a mental asylum inmate and then repeated her role from \"Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa\" in the Hindi version of the film, \"Ekk Deewana Tha\" (2012). Her popularity in Telugu films led to \"Nadunisi Naaygal\" was dubbed and released in Telugu as \"Eera Gulabeelu\", with Samantha featured prominently on the film's posters, despite only having a guest appearance. During the period, Samantha had also been signed two big-budget projects in Tamil, Mani Ratnam's \"Kadal\" (2013) and Shankar's \"I\" (2015), but was forced to opt out from both films, since she was suffering from a skin disease and could not work for two months during mid-2012. Samantha next featured in S. S. Rajamouli's live action Telugu-Tamil bilingual project \"Eega\" (2012) alongside Nani####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and Sudeep, portraying a micro artist who runs a NGO and takes revenge for the murder of her lover. As the film featured a CGI-created housefly as the main character, Samantha noted that she had to use her imagination and act accordingly. She also revealed that many heavy lights were used for the shoot of the film and she subsequently suffered skin burns, calling the process \"very stressful\" but \"satisfying\". Titled \"Naan Ee\" (2012) in Tamil, the film opened to highly positive reviews and Samantha also won high critical acclaim for her performance. A critic from \"The Hindu\" noted \"Samantha blooms in the role given to her,\" while Jeevi of \"Idlebrain.com\" wrote her \"successful run continues as she protrays the role a bereaved lover with perfection\". \"Sify.com\" also praised her performance in the film, citing her \"subtle expressions of love, fear and anxiety work well for the film\" and that she \"looks beautiful and has performed her role with consummate ease\". The film went on to become a major commercial success, grossing more than 1.25\u00a0billion, and went on to be dubbed in several foreign and Indian languages. Samantha then worked####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### on Gautham Vasudev Menon's a trilingual romantic drama film and played the leading female role of Nithya in the Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi versions of the film, shooting scenes simultaneously back-to-back with three different actors. The Tamil version, \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\" (2012) featured her alongside Jiiva, while \"Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu\" (2012) paired her opposite Nani. A further Hindi version titled \"Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau\" with Aditya Roy Kapoor was simultaneously shot with the other two films and was \"60%\" completed, before Menon shelved the venture after his other Hindi film, \"Ekk Deewana Tha\", had failed at the box office. The film spanned three periods in the life of a couple, focusing on their romantic relationship at school, college and in their late twenties. Samantha revealed that she knew Gautham would want to work with her again and immediately accepted the opportunity to portray the roles when she was offered the film. She felt that she \"could relate to the attributes and the circumstances the character goes through\" and described Nithya's character as \"close to her.\" To####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### make her performance as authentic as possible, Samantha chose to dub for herself in the Tamil version of the film. The Tamil and Telugu versions of the film opened in December 2012, earning polarizing reactions. \"Neethane En Ponvasantham\" earned mixed reviews and performed averagely at the box office, though Samantha received highly critical acclaim for her portrayal. The critic from \"The Hindu\" noted she \"comes up with possibly the best performance by a female lead in Tamil cinema this year\" and \"her transformation from a gawky teenager to an adult, unable to overcome her ego, is outstanding\". Meanwhile, IBN stated \"Samantha's transformation from a school kid to an adult is a treat to watch,\" while Rediff.com noted she is \"pretty, graceful, and does an excellent job of conveying the emotions of a girl in love, especially during the school sequence, while concluding she carries the film on her slender shoulders.\" The Telugu version, \"Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu\", received positive reviews and did well commercially, while Samantha's performance again received high critical acclaim. \"The Hindu\" wrote she \"goes a step further from her famous portrayal of Jessie (\"Ye Maaya Chesaave\") and brings####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### out the intricacy of her character well\", while \"The Times of India\" wrote \"Samantha has the author-backed role and she creams it.\" At the 60th Filmfare Awards South, she subsequently won the Best Actress awards for both the Tamil and Telugu film industries for her performances in \"Neethane En Ponvasantham\" and \"Eega\". Samantha became the second-ever actress to achieve the feat after Revathi had secured both awards in 1993. 2012 became her most prolific award-winning year and she secured further accolades for Best Actress at the Vijay Awards, Santosham Film Awards and the CineMAA Awards.</s><s>Career.:Commercial success and establishment in big-budget films (2013\u20132018). Although Samantha often portrayed strong character roles in her early films, post-2012, she has appeared increasingly in big-budget, hero-oriented films, which have comparatively smaller scope for actresses. Samantha next appeared in the Telugu multi-starrer film, \"Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu\" (2013) alongside Venkatesh and Mahesh Babu, which received positive reviews and was commercially successful. Though her role was comparatively minuscule to her co-####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####stars, \"IBN Live\" noted it was \"good to see Samantha shed her glamorous side and welcome performance-oriented roles, which she only handles with deftness and ease\". The romantic comedy \"Jabardasth\" (2013) alongside Siddharth, in which she portrayed a wedding planner, became a commercial failure, though critics noted Samantha is \"getting better by the day and it's a delight to watch her on screen\". Samantha then starred alongside Pawan Kalyan in the family drama, \"Attarintiki Daredi\" (2013), which emerged as the highest-grossing Telugu film upon release. A critic from Rediff.com noted Samantha \"exudes confidence even though she has limited screen time and nothing much to do\", and her performance saw her win Best Actress recognition at the SIIMA Awards and the Santosham Film Awards, in addition to her fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress \u2013 Telugu. Her final release of 2013 was in the unsuccessful Telugu masala film \"Ramayya Vasthavayya\", where she had a small role, with a critic noting \"we have seen Samantha in better roles and better films.\" The year 2014 saw Samantha appear in six films and make a return to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Tamil film industry. Her first release saw Samantha portray a dual role in the family drama film \"Manam\" (2014), where she featured alongside several members of the Akkineni film family. Featuring as a young mother and a college student in two different time eras, Samantha received positive reviews for her work, with the critic from Sify saying \"she excels\" and \"The Hindu\"s reviewer noting that she \"emotes well and easily shifts between the roles.\" Her performance fetched Samantha her fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress \u2013 Telugu, while she won Best Actress (Critics) at the SIIMA Awards. Samantha subsequently featured alongside Naga Chaitanya again in the long-delayed \"Autonagar Surya\" (2014), before playing different minuscule roles in the Telugu action masala films \"Alludu Seenu\" (2014) and \"Rabhasa\" (2014). Critics lamented that she \"signed up to be a glam doll\" for the ventures. She has \"previously shown us she is capable of doing much more, but of late, seems to be stuck with doing similar roles that require her to be an attractive prop.\" Samantha later revealed that she solely worked on \"All####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####udu Seenu\" as a favor to producer Bellamkonda Suresh, who had helped her delay the making of \"Jabardasth\" during her health problems. Samantha worked simultaneously on two big-budget Tamil films during early 2014, working with industry-leading actors and directors. N. Lingusamy's gangster masala film \"Anjaan\" (2014) opposite Suriya, received negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office. Portraying a small role, critics panned her character in the film, stating Samantha \"gamely performs the requisite crazy girl duties\". Her other release, AR Murugadoss's action drama \"Kaththi\" (2014) opposite Vijay won predominantly positive reviews and became the most profitable Tamil film of 2014. Again, reviewers criticised her character stating \"all she had to do in the film is smile and look pretty,\" while \"The Hindu\" remarked she played \"an emoticon\" and \"that covers her contribution to the proceedings\". She received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress \u2013 Tamil for her performance in \"Kaththi\". She subsequently featured in the Telugu film \"S/O Satyamurthy\" with Allu Arjun, as####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a part of another hero-oriented film, though critics noted she \"enacts her part with grace\" and that she \"plays her role well\". She then featured in her second dual role as a part of Vijay Milton's road film, \"10 Endrathukulla\" (2015), where she appeared alongside Vikram. She sported a different rural look for the role and her performance won mixed reviews, with a critic noting \"Samantha doesn't make much of an impact in the film except towards the end.\" Like \"Anjaan\" and \"Kaththi\", critics lamented her role as a clumsy girl, with \"Sify.com\" stating \"beyond a point Samantha's character is plainly annoying\". Samantha subsequently won positive reviews for her role and performance in Velraj's \"Thanga Magan\", where she featured opposite Dhanush. Portraying a homely role of a wife for the first time in Tamil films, the actress noted it would be the first of many such performance-oriented roles, as she looked to move away from being typecast in charming characters. A critic from \"Sify.com\" labelled her performance as \"impressive\", while \"DNA.com\" stated Samantha \"has given a very####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### subdued and mature performance sans drama\". Likewise, a reviewer from \"Silverscreen\", suggested that she \"delivers a performance that stands head and shoulders above her work in previous films\". Samantha's first release of 2016 was in the Tamil romantic drama film \"Bangalore Naatkal\", where she made a guest appearance and reprised Nithya Menen's minor role from the film's Malayalam original. She then portrayed the lead female role in Atlee's \"Theri\", and featured alongside Vijay for the second time. Her performance received positive reviews, with a critic from DNA India stating \"Samantha looks pretty as always\" and that \"she has done an incredible job in dubbing with a range of emotions in her numerous shades \u2013 doctor, lover, mother \u2013 and she shines\". Likewise, \"Behindwoods.com\" stated that \"Theri\" \"could be one of Samantha's best roles; she plays a doctor and has given out a soulful performance\". The film went on to become of the most profitable Tamil films of all time, upon release, and ended a barren spell for the actress in Tamil cinema, by becoming her first commercially successful film in Tamil cinema since \"Kaththi\" (2014). Samantha then worked for a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### second time with director Vikram Kumar and Suriya in the critically-acclaimed fantasy film \"24\". Featuring as the love interest of the film's lead character, Samantha won praise from critics for her small role in the film, with \"Sify.com\" stating that the actress \"does well in the comedy scenes.\" The film also performed well at the box office, with \"The Hindu\" stating she was \"at the top of the film industry,\" following her back-to-back commercial successes. She received two nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress \u2013 Tamil for her performances in \"Theri\" and \"24\" respectively.

She suffered from an immunity disorder and then had a further setback after her body did not respond well to antibiotics. She began dating actor Naga Chaitanya in 2010 after appearing in the film \"Ye Maaya Chesave\". The pair were engaged in a ceremony in Hyderabad on 29 January 2017. She got married in Goa as per traditional Hindu customs on 6 October 2017 and then by Christian customs on 7 October 2017, and became a member of the Akkineni family.

After June 2022, Samantha was suddenly inactive on social media which sparked several rumours about her health and there were rumours of her suffering from a relapse of a rare skin disorder.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### However, her team dismissed all rumours. On 29 October 2022, she announced that she was diagnosed with dermatomyositis.</s><s>Personal life and off-screen work.:Philanthropy. Samantha has actively been involved in philanthropic activities and donates her earnings from endorsements, product launches, and inauguration events to her charitable trust, Pratyusha Support, registered in 2012. She chose to begin the non-governmental organisation after being bed-ridden for 15 days during her documented illness in 2012, and wanted to give back to society. Samantha subsequently started the Pratyusha Support foundation to provide medical support for women and children with the help of three doctor friends. She provided full financial support for the program. She held a fundraiser in August 2013 to raise awareness of her foundation, auctioning several of her items and memorabilia from films. A further initiative in 2014 saw the launch of a program to fulfill the wishes of children with life-threatening diseases; Samantha financed trips for children to fly on an airplane and travel to the Taj Mahal, and organized opportunities for children to meet their favorite film actors. Samantha has also been involved in spreading awareness of haemophilia, regularly taking part in events creating awareness of the disease. Samantha agreed in January 2015 to pay a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### third of the hospital bills of one infant per week who required intensive care support at Andhra Hospitals through her charitable trust. Under the arrangement, Samantha agreed to contribute towards a third of the bills, while Andhra Hospitals would also pay a third of the bill, and the parents would pay the remaining third. In November 2015, Samantha entered into a further agreement with Andhra Hospitals to sponsor vaccination of all infants below six months for rotaviral infections free of cost. Later in the month, the actress took part in an organ donation pledge at Madhapur. During the 2015 Chennai floods, Samantha was situated in Hyderabad for the shoot of a film and helped mobilize the Mana Madras Kosam initiative organized by the Telugu film industry. Through the initiative, she participated in gathering relief materials at Ramanaidu Studios. She appealed to the Telugu-speaking public to help gather resources to send to Chennai. She later donated 30 lakh rupees for flood relief activities to take place in Pallavaram, the suburb in which the actress grew up. Samantha stood up for the cause of Handloom people of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states by wearing them and making photoshoots for handloom made sarees and other items. Samantha also launched####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a business venture 'Tweave' in partnership with the Telangana Government, which was a program to promote the handloom sector in Telangana.</s><s>Media image and artistry. The success of \"Ye Maaya Chesave\" (2010) and subsequent back-to-back successes prompted \"Rediff.com\" to label her \"the most sought-after actress in the Telugu film industry\" in 2014. Her initial choice of films depicted her as an actress who actively selects to feature in strong female roles, with \"The Times of India\" noting that \"scripts are written around the characters she portrays\" and that she held a place in the \"wishlist of every top actor, director and producer\". Her inclusion in Telugu film projects were also initially considered a \"lucky charm\" by producers, though Samantha acknowledged that though \"destiny\" played a role in her career, and that there were \"many women out there who are more beautiful and more talented\" than she was and that she hoped her name would instead be \"synonymous with hard work\". Samantha also stated that she was willing to forgo her salary demands to appear in good films, revealing that she worked on Gautham Vasudev Menon's films for lower####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### fees and that she had rejected more lucrative offers to feature in S. S. Rajamouli's \"Eega\" (2012). After portraying strong characters in her initial films, Samantha featured in increasingly hero-centric films in the mid-2010s. When questioned on her decision not to take up more heroine-oriented roles, Samantha lamented the lack of chances that the South Indian film industry presents for established female characters and described it as \"simply male-dominated\". She added that the market meant she was not going to \"get roles similar to her characters in \"Ye Maaya Chesave\" or \"Eega\" every time\" and accepted stories if it had \"the potential to engage viewers\". Talking about her glamorous role in her comeback Tamil film, \"Anjaan\" (2014), Samantha stated that she made a \"thoughtful call\" as \"it was important to do these kind of films to get exposure into the market,\" and that regrettably \"mass films\" were \"where the main audience\" was in South Indian cinema. She also added that she did not want to be \"typecast as the girl-next-door\" and was keen to prove critics wrong, who said that she could not fit into glamorous roles. In an interview in 2015####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, Samantha suggested that she was unhappy with her work during the previous year and would no longer do any more films where she would be \"required to do five songs and the scenes leading up to the songs\" and made a promise to herself that \"if she were not going to get good roles,\" she would quit acting. Being able to speak both Tamil and Telugu, Samantha has often been cast in bilingual films and has juggled her commitments between the Tamil and Telugu film industries. Even though she had a brief foray into Hindi cinema with the shelved \"Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau\", Samantha has distanced herself from working on Hindi language films, stating that she has no incentive to move to Bollywood unlike actresses of North Indian origin and that audiences from South India would relate to her appearance more. Her popularity has led to the actress representing several brands on a pan-Indian scale. She has often been cast opposite the same actors more than once, featuring in two or more films with Vijay, Suriya, Naga Chaitanya, Nani, Mahesh Babu and N. T. Rama Rao Jr., a feat Samantha revealed she takes \"pride in\". The actress has also regularly appreciated work by her contemporaries, and has praised performances####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### by Anushka Shetty, Nithya Menen and Sai Pallavi in particular. Samantha has also been involved in a few controversies due to voicing her opinions through Twitter. Following the release of a promotional poster for the Telugu film, \"\" (2014) in December 2013, Samantha criticized the depiction of actress Kriti Sanon crawling behind actor Mahesh Babu on the beach, who looks back at Kriti disapprovingly. Samantha tweeted that the poster was \"deeply regressive\" and stated that the makers were offensive to depict women like animals. The tweet received an adversely storming response from Mahesh Babu's fans, who launched a scathing attack on her online and targeted abuse at the actress. Her opinions were later backed by actor Siddharth and directors Sekhar Kammula and Nandini Reddy, who also resultantly faced similar abuse, before Mahesh Babu apologised. Through her tweets, she was also criticised for revealing actor Akhil's presence in \"Manam\" (2014) and retweeting a pirated image from her film \"10 Endrathukulla\" (2015). Her family home in Chennai was raided in late September 2015 by income tax officials, in a planned operation targeting film actors####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, though the actress and her father denied making any wrongful payments. In 2017, she was appointed as the ambassador for Telangana Handlooms by the government of Telangana and currently works to promote handloom textiles in the state of Telangana. She ranked 17th and 34th in The Times Most Desirable Women in 2019 and 2020 respectively. In March 2022, according to a report by \"The Times of India\", Samantha became the second highest-paid South Indian actress after Nayanthara.</s><s>Accolades.

In one of the first cases of its kind, Casali gave birth to a child sixteen months after the death of her husband, having been artificially inseminated using his stored frozen sperm. The case, which predated the Warnock Report, gave rise to legal discussions regarding the baby's rights of inheritance, and made front-page news across the world.

In 1967 she moved to Los Angeles where she met and began a relationship with Roberto Alfredo Vincenzo Casali, an Italian computer engineer, at a ski-club where they were both taking lessons. Casali had been drawing cartoons of humorous incidents####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### on the ski slopes, which Roberto encouraged, and she soon began adding cartoon illustrations to messages which she left for him. The very first drawing was created as a \"signature\" to a note, and represented Casali herself with freckles, large eyes and long fair hair.

It was a little bit like keeping a diary that described how my feelings had grown.\" In the September 1981 \"Cartoonist Profiles\" magazine she said: \"I drew a round blob of a girl who was supposed to be me, the one who was feeling all these fantastic things. Then I added a blob of a boy who was the reason I was feeling these things.\"</s><s>Syndication and success. Casali's obituary published in \"The Times\" related that after she and Roberto became engaged, Casali took a job as a receptionist for a design company, \"and made up little booklets of her winsome cartoons, which she sold for a dollar apiece.

The film's slogan was \"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\" Casali altered it into one of her most famous cartoons: \"Love is... being able to say you're sorry.\" While the cartoons proved to be very popular and were soon syndicated in the United States and overseas, being published in newspapers in fifty countries world-wide, Roberto's company had closed down and the couple \"found themselves living in the US illegally, 'trying to find jobs that would keep us one step ahead of the Immigration Department'\".

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Takeo Miki</s><s>Early life and family. Takeo Miki was born on 17 March 1907, in Gosho, Tokushima Prefecture (present-day Awa, Tokushima), the only child of farmer-merchant Hisayoshi Miki and his wife Takano. Aside from farming, his father traded fertilizers, sake, rice and general goods, though he was not a wealthy farmer (\"g\u014dn\u014d\") or from a family of pedigree (\"ky\u016bke\"). Hisayoshi was born in Kakihara, near Gosho, to farmer Rokusabur\u014d Ino'o, and after briefly working in Osaka, he returned and began working for the Shibata family, the largest landowner in Gosho. He met Takano Miki, the daughter of farmer Tokitar\u014d Miki, when the two were working for the Shibata family. Hisayoshi took Takano's surname after marriage, and the newlywed were given a house by the Shibata family. When Miki was born, Hisayoshi was 33 and Takano was 38 years old, and Miki was raised with much love as he was the only child. His mother was particularly careful about his healthcare. While studying at Me####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####iji University's Faculty of Law, Miki was able to visit the United States, where he saw firsthand both Anglo-American liberal society as well as that society's aversion towards totalitarian states such as Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and the Soviet Union. He attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in law from the institution in 1966.</s><s>Pre-LDP political career. During 1937 Miki was elected to the Diet; he remained there for the rest of his life, winning re-election no fewer than 19 times over 51 years. In the 1942 general election he openly voiced opposition to the military government under Hideki Tojo and still managed to win a seat; his efforts at this time were assisted by Kan Abe, the grandfather of Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe. In the earlier post-war period, Miki led the centrist National Cooperative Party in the 1947 and 1949 general elections, to limited success. In the early 1950s, Miki joined Ichir\u014d Hatoyama's Democratic Party, which was one of the two main conservative factions of the time and took a stance that was critical of Shigeru Yoshida and his Liberal Party. These two factions eventually merged in 1955 to form the modern-day####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which Miki joined as well.</s><s>Later political career (in the LDP). As the head of an LDP faction, Miki held cabinet posts in the administrations of Ichir\u014d Hatoyama, Nobusuke Kishi, Hayato Ikeda, and Eisaku Sat\u014d. However, he was especially critical of the Kishi administration, and was strongly opposed to Kishi's handling of the massive 1960 Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. When Kishi railroaded the treaty through the Diet on May 19, 1960, Miki's faction absented itself from the vote in protest of Kishi's heavy-handed approach. On May 28, Miki and fellow faction leader Kenz\u014d Matsumura issued a public call for Kishi's resignation, and Kishi was ultimately forced to resign in July. However when Ichir\u014d K\u014dno floated a plan later that summer to split up the LDP, Miki and Matsumura ultimately declined to support him. As punishment for taking part in the anti-Kishi rebellion, Miki was initially excluded from the cabinet of Kishi's successor Hayato Ikeda. However by the following year, Ikeda####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### had cemented his power enough to overcome the objections of the Kishi faction and bring Miki back into the cabinet as Head of the Science and Technology Agency. Although Ikeda was re-elected as party president in 1964, he retired soon afterwards due to illness. In the debate over who would succeed Ikeda as prime minister, Miki supported Kishi's brother Eisaku Sat\u014d while Matsumura supported Ichir\u014d K\u014dno. This led to a falling out between Miki and his erstwhile ally Matsumura, and thereafter the two men went their separate ways. Miki's support for Sat\u014d also healed the rift that had been created when he had opposed Kishi during the Anpo crisis, and Miki was rewarded for his support with powerful posts in the Sat\u014d cabinet, first as Minister of International Trade and Industry (1965\u201366) and then as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1966-68). As the foreign minister under Sat\u014d, Miki secretly met in 1967 with American ambassador to Japan U. Alexis Johnson to discuss \"how to reconcile Japanese desire for reversion [of Okinawa] with [American] military requirements.\" This was part of a series of resolute attempts by several Japanese officials within the same time period aimed at####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### convincing the United States to reconsider its continued hold on Okinawa, which the U.S. had formerly insisted should remain under American protection so long as there was any remaining instability in East Asia. In matters of regional foreign policy, Miki was an early advocate of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and, in 1968, he said that \"'it would be an act of suicide on our part to create an exclusive and closed trading bloc in the Pacific area.\" Despite this, ASEAN would later decline to invite now-Prime Minister Miki to the organisation's very first summit at Bali in 1976, as economic perceptions towards Japan in the region were negative because of resentment towards both wartime abuse by Imperial Japan as well as Japan's current status as a powerful economic giant with a heavy trade surplus. Miki took over from Kakuei Tanaka as Prime Minister on 9 December 1974, following the latter's implication in the corruption concerning real-estate and construction companies. The attractiveness of Miki to the LDP bosses was chiefly due to his personal integrity, and his weak power base from his small faction. In fact, Miki had neither expected nor wanted to be prime minister at all, as was reflected when upon his election he murmured \"a bolt from the blue\". While Miki was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### at the funeral of ex-PM Eisaku Sato in 1975, he was assaulted by a right-wing extremist named Hiroyoshi Fudeyasu, the secretary-general of the Greater Japan Patriotic Party with foreign dignitaries nearby. This caused criticism of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police over not doing enough to ensure his safety. In a 1976 Diet session, Miki reaffirmed a past order of Prime Minister Sat\u014d's cabinet dating back to 1967 in which the percent of the national GDP allocated towards defense spending was frozen so as to not exceed 1%. This policy taboo was broken by future Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in the 1980s, but was revived in 1990 by another future Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, who was a member of the faction that descended from Miki's faction. This policy has again come under renewed attention within modern Japan in light of contemporary discussions about constitutional revision and, by extension, the possible expansion of Japan's defense capabilities. In any event, Miki also pushed the Diet to fully ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and he also worked to further strengthen previous policies set in motion by Prime Minister Sat\u014d which virtually committed Japan to not engage in the export of arms to any####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### country. After being elected, Miki attempted to reform the LDP, relentlessly investigating the Lockheed bribery scandals and refusing to halt the criminal prosecutions being made against his predecessor. Miki also pursued political finance reforms. These activities made him a large number of enemies within the party, and a campaign literally called \"Down with Miki\" (\"\"Miki oroshi\"\") was started by influential faction leaders. Despite Miki's personal popularity with the public, the Lockheed scandal reflected poorly on the party, which lost its overall majority in the 1976 election to the Diet and had to make deals with minor parties to remain in power. As is customary for Japanese political officials following heavy party setbacks, Miki then resigned. He was succeeded on 24 December 1976, by Takeo Fukuda.</s><s>Legacy. In Mao Zedong's final days, he took a great interest in Miki's political condition, as Miki was suffering a coup d'\u00e9tat from amongst his own party. Mao had never shown any interest in Miki before, or even mentioned him. NFL player Takeo Spikes was named after Miki.</s><s>Legacy.:Connection to Seattle. During his time in Seattle, Miki spent a period as a dishwasher at noted Japanese restaurant Man####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####eki. To commemorate the ties of Japan to America, and Seattle in particular, Miki gave 1,000 cherry trees to Seattle to commemorate the United States Bicentennial in 1976. This gift gave birth to the, still running annually.</s><s>Legacy.:Slang Term. In Hong Kong, the name \"Takeo Miki\" (\u4e09\u6728\u6b66\u592b) is sometimes used to describe actors or actresses with wooden or no emotional expressions during movies or TV dramas. Some have said that the origin for the slang term stems from Miki's wooden expression during his appearance in news reports.</s><s>Honours. - Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (14 November 1988; posthumous)</s><s>Honours.:Foreign honour. - : Sash of the Order of the Aztec Eagle (18 September 1967)</s><s>References.</s><s>References.:Works cited. -</s>", "Takeo Miki was a Japanese politician who served as the 41st Prime Minister of Japan from 1974 to 1976.

Wong was featured in films of the early sound era, and went on to appear in \"Daughter of the Dragon\" (1931), with Marlene Dietrich in Josef von Sternberg's \"Shanghai Express\" (1932), \"Java Head\" (1934), and \"Daughter of Shanghai\" (1937). In 1935, Wong was dealt the most severe disappointment of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in the film version of Pearl S. Buck's \"The Good Earth\". MGM instead cast Luise Rainer to play the leading role in yellowface. One biographer believes that the choice was due to the Hays Code anti-miscegenation rules requiring the wife of a white actor, Paul Muni (ironically playing a Chinese character in yellowface) to be played by a white actress. But the 1930\u20131934 Hays Code of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America insisted only that \"miscegenation (sex relationship between####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the white and black races) was forbidden\" and said nothing about other interracial marriages. Other biographers have not corroborated this theory, including historian Shirley Jennifer Lim's \"Anna May Wong: Performing the Modern\". MGM screen-tested Wong for the supporting role of Lotus, the seductress, but it is ambiguous whether she refused the role on principle or was rejected. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village, studying Chinese culture, and documenting the experience on film at a time when prominent female directors in Hollywood were few. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to help the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances. In 1951, Wong made history with her television show \"The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong\", the first-ever U.S. television show starring an Asian American series lead. She had been planning to return to film in \"Flower Drum Song\" when she died in 1961, at the age of 56, from a heart attack. For decades after her death####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, Wong was remembered principally for the stereotypical \"Dragon Lady\" and demure \"Butterfly\" roles that she was often given. Her life and career were re-evaluated in the years around the centennial of her birth, in three major literary works and film retrospectives.</s><s>Biography.</s><s>Biography.:Early life. Anna May Wong was born Wong Liu Tsong (, \"Liu Tsong\" literally meaning \"willow frost\") on January 3, 1905, on Flower Street in Los Angeles, one block north of Chinatown, in an integrated community of Chinese, Irish, German and Japanese residents. She was the second of seven children born to Wong Sam-sing, owner of the Sam Kee Laundry, and his second wife, Lee Gon-toy. Wong's parents were second-generation Chinese Americans; her maternal and paternal grandparents had resided in the U.S. since at least 1855. Her paternal grandfather, A Wong Wong, was a merchant who owned two stores in Michigan Bluffs, a gold-mining area in Placer County. He had come from Chang On, a village near Taishan, Guangdong Province, China, in 1853. Anna May's father spent his youth traveling between the U####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####.S. and China, where he married his first wife and fathered a son in 1890. He returned to the U.S. in the late 1890s and in 1901, while continuing to support his family in China, he married a second wife, Anna May's mother. Anna May's older sister Lew-ying (Lulu) was born in late 1902, and Anna May in 1905, followed by five more children. In 1910, the family moved to a neighborhood on Figueroa Street where they were the only Chinese people on their block, living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture. She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students, they moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a Chinese language school afternoons and on Saturdays. About that same time, U.S. motion picture production began to relocate from the East Coast to the Los Angeles area. Movies were shot constantly in and around Wong's neighborhood. She began going to Nickelodeon movie theaters and quickly became obsessed with the \"flickers\", missing school and using lunch money####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to attend the cinema. Her father was not happy with her interest in films, feeling that it interfered with her studies, but Wong decided to pursue a film career regardless. At the age of nine, she constantly begged filmmakers to give her roles, earning herself the nickname \"C.C.C.\" or \"Curious Chinese Child\". By the age of 11, Wong had come up with her stage name of Anna May Wong, formed by joining both her English and family names.</s><s>Biography.:Early career. Wong was working at Hollywood's Ville de Paris department store when Metro Pictures needed 300\u00a0female extras to appear in Alla Nazimova's film \"The Red Lantern\" (1919). Without her father's knowledge, a friend of his with movie connections helped her land an uncredited role as an extra carrying a lantern. Wong worked steadily for the next two years as an extra in various movies, including Priscilla Dean and Colleen Moore pictures. While still a student, Wong came down with an illness identified as St. Vitus's Dance which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### more to do with her dislike of the methods. Other Chinese thought such as Confucianism and particularly Taoism and the teachings of Laozi had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life. The family's religious life also included Christian thought, in the form of Presbyterianism, and as an adult she was a Christian Scientist for some time. Finding it difficult to keep up with both her schoolwork and her passion, Wong dropped out of Los Angeles High School in 1921 to pursue a full-time acting career. Reflecting on her decision, Wong told \"Motion Picture Magazine\" in 1931: \"I was so young when I began that I knew I still had youth if I failed, so I determined to give myself 10\u00a0years to succeed as an actress.\" In 1921, Wong received her first screen credit for \"Bits of Life\", the first anthology film, in which she played the wife of Lon Chaney's character, Toy Ling, in a segment entitled \"Hop\". She later recalled it fondly as the only time she played the role of a mother; her appearance earned her a cover photo on the British magazine \"Picture Show\". At the age of 17, Wong played her first leading role, in the early Metro two-color Technicol####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####or movie \"The Toll of the Sea\". Written by Frances Marion, the story was based loosely on \"Madama Butterfly\". \"Variety\" magazine singled Wong out for praise, noting her \"extraordinarily fine\" acting. \"The New York Times\" commented, \"Miss Wong stirs in the spectator all the sympathy her part calls for and she never repels one by an excess of theatrical 'feeling'. She has a difficult role, a role that is botched nine times out of ten, but hers is the tenth performance. Completely unconscious of the camera, with a fine sense of proportion and remarkable pantomimic accuracy\u00a0... She should be seen again and often on the screen.\" Despite such reviews, Hollywood proved reluctant to create starring roles for Wong; her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from seeing her as a leading lady. David Schwartz, the chief curator of the Museum of the Moving Image, notes, \"She built up a level of stardom in Hollywood, but Hollywood didn't know what to do with her.\" She spent the next few years in supporting roles providing \"exotic atmosphere\", for instance playing a concubine in Tod Browning's \"Drifting\" (1923). Film producers capitalized on Wong's growing fame####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### but they relegated her to supporting roles. Still optimistic about a film career, in 1923 Wong said: \"Pictures are fine and I'm getting along all right, but it's not so bad to have the laundry back of you, so you can wait and take good parts and be independent when you're climbing.\"</s><s>Biography.:Stardom. At the age of 19, Wong was cast in a supporting role as a scheming Mongol slave in the 1924 Douglas Fairbanks picture \"The Thief of Bagdad\". Playing a stereotypical \"Dragon Lady\" role, her brief appearances on-screen caught the attention of audiences and critics alike. The film grossed more than $2\u00a0million and helped introduce Wong to the public. Around this time, Wong had an interracial relationship with Tod Browning, who had directed her in \"Drifting\" a year earlier. After this second prominent role, Wong moved out of the family home into her own apartment. Conscious that Americans viewed her as \"foreign-born\" even though she was born and raised in California, Wong began cultivating a flapper image. In March 1924, planning to make films about Chinese myths, she signed a deal creating Anna May Wong Productions; when her business partner was found to be engaging in dishonest####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### practices, Wong brought a lawsuit against him and the company was dissolved. It soon became evident that Wong's career would continue to be limited by American anti-miscegenation laws, which prevented her from sharing an on-screen kiss with any person of another race, even if the character was Asian but being portrayed by a white actor. The only leading Asian man in U.S. films in the silent era was Sessue Hayakawa. Unless Asian leading men could be found, Wong could not be a leading lady. Wong continued to be offered exotic supporting roles that followed the rising \"vamp\" stereotype in cinema. She played indigenous native girls in two 1924 films. Filmed on location in the Territory of Alaska, she portrayed an Eskimo in \"The Alaskan\". She returned to Los Angeles to perform the part of Princess Tiger Lily in \"Peter Pan\". Both films were shot by cinematographer James Wong Howe. \"Peter Pan\" was more successful, and it was the hit of the Christmas season. The next year, Wong was singled out for critical praise in a manipulative Oriental vamp role in the film \"Forty Winks\". Despite such favorable reviews, she became increasingly disappointed with her casting and began to seek other roads to success. In####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### early 1925 she joined a group of serial stars on a tour of the vaudeville circuits; when the tour proved to be a failure, Wong and the rest of the group returned to Hollywood. In 1926, Wong put the first rivet into the structure of Grauman's Chinese Theatre when she joined Norma Talmadge for its groundbreaking ceremony, although she was not invited to leave her hand- and foot-prints in cement. In the same year, Wong starred in \"The Silk Bouquet\". Re-titled \"The Dragon Horse\" in 1927, the film was one of the first U.S. films to be produced with Chinese backing, provided by San Francisco's Chinese Six Companies. The story was set in China during the Ming dynasty and featured Asian actors playing the Asian roles. Wong continued to be assigned supporting roles. Hollywood's Asian female characters tended toward two stereotypical poles: the na\u00efve and self-sacrificing \"Butterfly\" and the sly and deceitful \"Dragon Lady\". In \"Old San Francisco\" (1927), directed by Alan Crosland for Warner Brothers, Wong played a \"Dragon Lady\", a gangster's daughter. In \"Mr. Wu\" (1927), she played a supporting role as increasing censorship against mixed####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-race onscreen couples cost her the lead. In \"The Crimson City\", released the following year, this happened again.</s><s>Biography.:Move to Europe. Tired of being both typecast and passed over for lead Asian character roles in favor of non-Asian actresses, Wong left Hollywood in 1928 for Europe. Interviewed by Doris Mackie for \"Film Weekly\" in 1933, Wong complained about her Hollywood roles: \"I was so tired of the parts I had to play.\" She commented: \"There seems little for me in Hollywood, because, rather than real Chinese, producers prefer Hungarians, Mexicans, American Indians for Chinese roles.\" In Europe, Wong became a sensation, starring in notable films such as \"Schmutziges Geld\" (aka \"Song\" and \"Show Life\", 1928) and \"Gro\u00dfstadtschmetterling\" (\"Pavement Butterfly\"). Of the German critics' response to \"Song\", \"The New York Times\" reported that Wong was \"acclaimed not only as an actress of transcendent talent but as a great beauty\". The article noted that Germans passed over Wong's American background: \"Berlin critics, who were unanimous in praise of both the star and the production, neglect to mention that Anna May####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### is of American birth. They mention only her Chinese origins.\" In Vienna, she played the title role in the operetta \"Tschun Tschi\" in fluent German. An Austrian critic wrote, \"Fr\u00e4ulein Wong had the audience perfectly in her power and the unobtrusive tragedy of her acting was deeply moving, carrying off the difficult German-speaking part very successfully.\" While in Germany, Wong became an inseparable friend of the director Leni Riefenstahl. Her close friendships with several women throughout her life, including Marlene Dietrich and Cecil Cunningham, led to rumors of lesbianism which damaged her public reputation. These rumors, in particular of her supposed relationship with Dietrich, further embarrassed Wong's family. They had long been opposed to her acting career, which was not considered an entirely respectable profession at the time. London producer Basil Dean brought the play \"A Circle of Chalk\" for Wong to appear in with the young Laurence Olivier, her first stage performance in the United Kingdom. Criticism of her California accent, described by one critic as a \"Yankee squeak\", led to Wong seeking vocal tutoring at Cambridge University, where she trained in received pronunciation. Composer Constant Lambert, infatuated with the actress after####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### having seen her in films, attended the play on its opening night and subsequently composed \"Eight Poems of Li Po\", dedicated to her. Wong made her last silent film, \"Piccadilly\", in 1929, the first of five British films in which she had a starring role. The film caused a sensation in the UK. Gilda Gray was the top-billed actress, but \"Variety\" commented that Wong \"outshines the star\" and that \"from the moment Miss Wong dances in the kitchen's rear, she steals 'Piccadilly' from Miss Gray.\" Though the film presented Wong in her most sensual role yet of the five films, once again she was not permitted to kiss her white love interest and a controversial planned scene involving a kiss was cut before the film was released. Forgotten for decades after its release, \"Piccadilly\" was later restored by the British Film Institute. \"Time\" magazine's Richard Corliss calls \"Piccadilly\" Wong's best film, and \"The Guardian\" reports that the rediscovery of this film and Wong's performance in it has been responsible for a restoration of the actress' reputation. While in London, Wong was romantically linked with writer and broadcasting executive Eric Maschwitz####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, who wrote the lyrics to \"These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)\", possibly as an evocation of his longing for her after they parted. Wong's first talkie was \"The Flame of Love\" (1930), which she recorded in French, English, and German. Though Wong's performance\u2060\u2014particularly her handling of the three languages\u2060\u2014was lauded, all three versions of the film received negative reviews.</s><s>Biography.:Return to Hollywood. During the 1930s, American studios were looking for fresh European talent. Ironically, Wong caught their eye, and she was offered a contract with Paramount Studios in 1930. Enticed by the promise of lead roles and top billing, she returned to the United States. The prestige and training she had gained during her years in Europe led to a starring role on Broadway in \"On the Spot\", a drama that ran for 167\u00a0performances and which she would later film as \"Dangerous to Know\". When the play's director wanted Wong to use stereotypical Japanese mannerisms, derived from \"Madame Butterfly\", in her performance of a Chinese character, Wong refused. She instead used her knowledge of Chinese style and gestures to imbue the character with a greater degree of authenticity. Following her return####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to Hollywood in 1930, Wong repeatedly turned to the stage and cabaret for a creative outlet. In November 1930, Wong's mother was struck and killed by an automobile in front of the Figueroa Street house. The family remained at the house until 1934 when Wong's father returned to his hometown in China with Anna May's younger brothers and sister. Anna May had been paying for the education of her younger siblings, who put their education to work after they relocated to China. Before the family left, Wong's father wrote a brief article for \"Xinning\", a magazine for overseas Taishanese, in which he expressed his pride in his famous daughter. With the promise of appearing in a Josef von Sternberg film, Wong accepted another stereotypical role\u00a0\u2013 the title character of Fu Manchu's vengeful daughter in \"Daughter of the Dragon\" (1931). This was the last stereotypically \"evil Chinese\" role Wong played, and also her one starring appearance alongside the only other well-known Asian actor of the era, Sessue Hayakawa. Though she was given the starring role, this status was not reflected in her paycheck: she was paid $6,000, while Hayakawa received $10,000 and Warner Oland####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, who is only in the film for 23\u00a0minutes, was paid $12,000. Wong began using her newfound celebrity to make political statements: late in 1931, for example, she wrote a harsh criticism of the Mukden Incident and Japan's subsequent invasion of Manchuria. She also became more outspoken in her advocacy for Chinese American causes and for better film roles. In a 1933 interview for \"Film Weekly\" entitled \"I Protest\", Wong criticized the negative stereotyping in \"Daughter of the Dragon\", saying, \"Why is it that the screen Chinese is always the villain? And so crude a villain\u2014murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass! We are not like that. How could we be, with a civilization that is so many times older than the West?\" Wong appeared alongside Marlene Dietrich as a self-sacrificing courtesan in Sternberg's \"Shanghai Express\". Her sexually charged scenes with Dietrich have been noted by many commentators and fed rumors about the relationship between the two stars. Though contemporary reviews focused on Dietrich's acting and Sternberg's direction, film historians today judge that Wong's performance upstaged that of Dietrich. The Chinese press had long given Wong's career very mixed reviews,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and were less than favorable to her performance in \"Shanghai Express\". A Chinese newspaper ran the headline: \"Paramount Utilizes Anna May Wong to Produce Picture to Disgrace China\" and continued, \"Although she is deficient in artistic portrayal, she has done more than enough to disgrace the Chinese race.\" Critics in China believed that Wong's on-screen sexuality spread negative stereotypes of Chinese women. The most virulent criticism came from the Nationalist government, but China's intellectuals and liberals were not always so opposed to Wong, as demonstrated when Peking University awarded the actress an honorary doctorate in 1932. Contemporary sources reported that this was probably the only time that an actor had been so honored. In both America and Europe, Wong had been seen as a fashion icon for over a decade. In 1934, the Mayfair Mannequin Society of New York voted her \"The World's best-dressed woman\" and in 1938 \"Look\" magazine named her \"The World's most beautiful Chinese girl\".</s><s>Biography.:Atlantic crossings. After her success in Europe and a prominent role in \"Shanghai Express\", Wong's Hollywood career returned to its old pattern. She was passed over for the leading female role in \"The Son-Daughter\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in favor of Helen Hayes; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer deemed her \"too Chinese to play a Chinese\" in the film. Wong was scheduled to play the role of a mistress to a corrupt Chinese general in Frank Capra's \"The Bitter Tea of General Yen\" (1933), but the role went instead to Toshia Mori. Again disappointed with Hollywood, Wong returned to Britain, where she stayed for nearly three years. In addition to appearing in four films, she toured Scotland and Ireland as part of a vaudeville show. She also appeared in the King George Silver Jubilee program in 1935. Her film \"Java Head\" (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong kissed the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites. While in London, Wong met Mei Lanfang, one of the most famous stars of the Beijing Opera. She had long been interested in Chinese opera and Mei offered to instruct Wong if she ever visited China. In the 1930s, the popularity of Pearl Buck's novels, especially \"The Good Earth\", as well as growing American sympathy for####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### China in its struggles with Japanese imperialism, opened up opportunities for more positive Chinese roles in U.S. films. Wong returned to the U.S. in June 1935 with the goal of obtaining the role of O-lan, the lead female character in MGM's film version of \"The Good Earth\". Since its publication in 1931, Wong had made known her desire to play O-lan in a film version of the book; and as early as 1933, Los Angeles newspapers were touting Wong as the best choice for the part. Nevertheless, the studio apparently never seriously considered Wong for the role. The Chinese government also advised the studio against casting Wong in the role. The Chinese advisor to MGM commented: \"whenever she appears in a movie, the newspapers print her picture with the caption 'Anna May again loses face for China'\u00a0\". According to Wong, she was instead offered the part of Lotus, a deceitful song girl who helps to destroy the family and seduces the family's oldest son. Wong refused the role, telling MGM head of production Irving Thalberg, \"If you let me play O-lan, I will be very glad. But you're asking me\u2014with Chinese blood\u2014to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### all-American cast portraying Chinese characters.\" The role Wong hoped for went to Luise Rainer, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Wong's sister, Mary Liu Heung Wong, appeared in the film in the role of the Little Bride. MGM's refusal to consider Wong for this most high-profile of Chinese characters in U.S. film is remembered today as \"one of the most notorious cases of casting discrimination in the 1930s\".</s><s>Biography.:Chinese tour and rising popularity. After the major disappointment of losing the role in \"The Good Earth\", Wong announced plans for a year-long tour of China, to visit her father and his family in Taishan. Wong's father had returned to his hometown in China with her younger brothers and sister in 1934. Aside from Mei Lanfang's offer to teach her, she wanted to learn more about the Chinese theater and through English translations to better perform some Chinese plays before international audiences. She told the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" on her departure, \"... for a year, I shall study the land of my fathers. Perhaps upon my arrival, I shall feel like an outsider. Perhaps instead, I shall find my past life assuming a dreamlike quality of unreality.\" Embarking in January####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 1936, Wong chronicled her experiences in a series of articles printed in U.S. newspapers such as the \"New York Herald Tribune\", the \"Los Angeles Examiner\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"Photoplay\". In a stopover in Tokyo on the way to Shanghai, local reporters, ever curious about her romantic life, asked if she had marriage plans, to which Wong replied, \"No, I am wedded to my art.\" The following day, however, Japanese newspapers reported that Wong was married to a wealthy Cantonese man named \"Art\". During her travels in China, Wong continued to be strongly criticized by the Nationalist government and the film community. She had difficulty communicating in many areas of China because she was raised with the Taishan dialect rather than Mandarin. She later commented that some of the varieties of Chinese sounded \"as strange to me as Gaelic. I thus had the strange experience of talking to my own people through an interpreter.\" The toll of international celebrity on Wong's personal life manifested itself in bouts of depression and sudden anger, as well as excessive smoking and drinking. Feeling irritable when she disembarked in Hong Kong, Wong was uncharacteristically rude to the awaiting crowd, which then quickly turned hostile. One person shouted:####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"Down with Huang Liu-tsong\u2014the stooge that disgraces China. Don't let her go ashore.\" Wong began crying and a stampede ensued. After she left for a short trip to the Philippines, the situation cooled and Wong joined her family in Hong Kong. With her father and her siblings, Wong visited his family and his first wife at the family's ancestral home near Taishan. Conflicting reports claim that she was either warmly welcomed or met with hostility by the villagers. She spent over 10\u00a0days in the family's village and sometime in neighboring villages before continuing her tour of China. After returning to Hollywood, Wong reflected on her year in China and her career in Hollywood: \"I am convinced that I could never play in the Chinese Theatre. I have no feeling for it. It's a pretty sad situation to be rejected by Chinese because I'm 'too American' and by American producers, because they prefer other races to act Chinese parts.\" Wong's father returned to Los Angeles in 1938.</s><s>Biography.:Late 1930s and further work films. To complete her contract with Paramount Pictures, Wong made a string of B movies in the late 1930s. Often dismissed by critics, the films gave Wong non-stereotyp####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ical roles that were publicized in the Chinese-American press for their positive images. These smaller-budgeted films could be bolder than the higher-profile releases and Wong used this to her advantage to portray successful, professional, Chinese-American characters. Competent and proud of their Chinese heritage, these characters worked against the prevailing U.S. film portrayals of Chinese Americans. In contrast to the usual official Chinese condemnation of Wong's film roles, the Chinese consul to Los Angeles gave his approval to the final scripts of two of these films, \"Daughter of Shanghai\" (1937) and \"King of Chinatown\" (1939). In \"Daughter of Shanghai\", Wong played the Asian-American female lead in a role that was rewritten for her as the heroine of the story, actively setting the plot into motion rather than the more passive character originally planned. The script was so carefully tailored for Wong that at one point it was given the working title \"Anna May Wong Story\". When the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2006, the announcement described it as \"more truly Wong's personal vehicle than any of her other films\". Of this film, Wong told \"Hollywood Magazine\", \"I like my part in this picture better####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### than any I've had before\u00a0... because this picture gives Chinese a break\u2014we have sympathetic parts for a change! To me, that means a great deal.\" \"The New York Times\" gave the film a generally positive review, commenting of its B-movie origins, \"An unusually competent cast saves the film from the worst consequences of certain inevitable banalities. [The cast]\u00a0... combine with effective sets to reduce the natural odds against any pictures in the \"Daughter of Shanghai\" tradition.\" In October 1937, the press carried rumors that Wong had plans to marry her male co-star in this film, childhood friend and Korean-American actor Philip Ahn. Wong replied, \"It would be like marrying my brother.\" Bosley Crowther was not so kind to \"Dangerous to Know\" (1938), which he called a \"second-rate melodrama, hardly worthy of the talents of its generally capable cast\". In \"King of Chinatown,\" Wong played a surgeon who sacrifices a high-paying promotion in order to devote her energies to helping the Chinese fight the Japanese invasion. \"The New York Times\"' Frank Nugent gave the film a negative review. Though he commented positively on its advocacy of the Chinese in their fight against Japan, he wrote####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, \"...\u00a0Paramount should have spared us and its cast\u00a0... the necessity of being bothered with such folderol\". Paramount also employed Wong as a tutor to other actors, such as Dorothy Lamour in her role as a Eurasian in \"Disputed Passage\". Wong performed on radio several times, including a 1939 role as \"Peony\" in Pearl Buck's \"The Patriot\" on Orson Welles' \"The Campbell Playhouse\". Wong's cabaret act, which included songs in Cantonese, French, English, German, Danish, Swedish, and other languages, took her from the U.S. to Europe and Australia through the 1930s and 1940s. In 1938, after she auctioned off her movie costumes and donated the money to Chinese aid, the Chinese Benevolent Association of California honored Wong for her work in support of Chinese refugees. The proceeds from the preface that she wrote in 1942 to a cookbook entitled \"New Chinese Recipes\", one of the first Chinese cookbooks, were also dedicated to United China Relief. Between 1939 and 1942, she made few films, instead engaging in events and appearances in support of the Chinese struggle against Japan. Being sick of the negative typecasting that had enveloped her throughout her American career, Wong visited Australia####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### for more than three months in 1939. There she was the star attraction in a vaudeville show entitled 'Highlights from Hollywood' at the Tivoli Theatre in Melbourne.</s><s>Biography.:Later years and 1945 film success. Wong attended several socialite events at the Mission Inn in Riverside, California, in 1941. Wong starred in \"Bombs over Burma\" (1942) and \"Lady from Chungking\" (1942), both anti-Japanese propaganda made by the poverty row studio Producers Releasing Corporation. She donated her salary for both films to United China Relief. \"The Lady from Chungking\" differed from the usual Hollywood war film in that the Chinese were portrayed as heroes rather than as victims rescued by Americans. Even after American characters are captured by the Japanese, the primary goal of the heroes is not to free the Americans, but to prevent the Japanese from entering the city of Chongqing (Chungking). Also, in an interesting twist, the Chinese characters are portrayed by Chinese-American actors, while the Japanese villains\u2014normally played by Chinese-American actors\u2014are acted by European Americans. The film ends with Wong making a speech for the birth of a \"new China\". \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and \"Variety\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### both gave Wong's performance in \"The Lady from Chungking\" positive reviews but commented negatively on the film's plot. A Democrat, Wong was supportive of Adlai Stevenson's campaign during the 1952 presidential election. Later in life, Wong invested in real estate and owned a number of properties in Hollywood. She converted her home on San Vicente Boulevard in Santa Monica into four apartments that she called \"Moongate Apartments\". She served as the apartment house manager from the late 1940s until 1956, when she moved in with her brother Richard on 21st Place in Santa Monica. In 1949, Wong's father died in Los Angeles at the age of 91. After a six-year absence, Wong returned to film the same year with a small role in a B movie called \"Impact\". From August 27 to November 21, 1951, Wong starred in a detective series that was written specifically for her, the DuMont Television Network series \"The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong\", in which she played the title role that used her birth name. Wong's character was a dealer in Chinese art whose career involved her in detective work and international intrigue. The ten half-hour episodes aired during prime time, from 9:00 to 9:30\u00a0pm. Although there were####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### plans for a second season, DuMont canceled the show in 1952. No copies of the show or its scripts are known to exist. After the completion of the series, Wong's health began to deteriorate. In late 1953 she suffered an internal hemorrhage, which her brother attributed to the onset of menopause, her continued heavy drinking, and financial worries. In 1956, Wong hosted one of the first U.S. documentaries on China narrated entirely by a Chinese American. Broadcast on the ABC travel series \"Bold Journey\", the program consisted of film footage from her 1936 trip to China. Wong also did guest spots on television series such as \"Adventures in Paradise\", \"The Barbara Stanwyck Show\", and \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\". For her contribution to the film industry, Anna May Wong received a star at 1708\u00a0Vine Street on the inauguration of the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. She was the first Asian American actress to receive this honor. She is also depicted larger-than-life as one of the four supporting pillars of the \"Gateway to Hollywood\" sculpture located on the southeast corner of Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, with the actresses Dolores del R\u00edo (Hispanic American), Dorothy Dandridge####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### (African American), and Mae West (White American). In 1960, Wong returned to film in \"Portrait in Black\", starring Lana Turner. She still found herself stereotyped, with one press release explaining her long absence from films with a supposed proverb, which was claimed to have been passed down to Wong by her father: \"Don't be photographed too much or you'll lose your soul\", a quote that would be inserted into many of her obituaries.</s><s>Biography.:Later life and death. Wong was scheduled to play the role of Madame Liang in the film production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Flower Drum Song\", but was unable to take the role owing to her health problems. On February 3, 1961, at the age of 56, Wong died of a heart attack as she slept at home in Santa Monica, two days after her final screen performance on television's \"The Barbara Stanwyck Show\" in an episode entitled \"Dragon by the Tail\". (Wong had appeared in another story in the same series the previous year.) Her cremated remains were interred in her mother's grave at Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles. The headstone is marked with her mother's Anglicized name on top, and the Chinese names of Anna May####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### (on the right) and her sister Mary (on the left) along the sides.</s><s>Legacy. Wong's image and career have left a notable legacy. Through her films, public appearances and prominent magazine features, she helped to humanize Chinese Americans to mainstream American audiences during a period of intense racism and discrimination. Chinese Americans had been viewed as perpetually foreign in U.S. society, but Wong's films and public image established her as a Chinese-American citizen at a time when laws discriminated against Chinese immigration and citizenship. Wong's hybrid image dispelled contemporary notions that the East and West were inherently different. Among Wong's films, only \"Shanghai Express\" retained critical attention in the U.S. in the decades after her death. In Europe and especially England, her films appeared occasionally at festivals. Wong remained popular with the gay community, who claimed her as one of their own and for whom her marginalization by the mainstream became a symbol. Although the Chinese Nationalist criticism of her portrayals of the \"Dragon Lady\" and \"Butterfly\" stereotypes lingered, she was forgotten in China. Nevertheless, the importance of Wong's legacy within the Asian-American film community can be seen in the Anna May Wong Award of Excellence, which is given####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### yearly at the Asian-American Arts Awards; the annual award given out by the Asian Fashion Designers group was also named after Wong in 1973. Wong's image remained as a symbol in literature as well as in the film. In the 1971 poem \"The Death of Anna May Wong\", Jessica Hagedorn saw Wong's career as one of \"tragic glamour\" and portrayed the actress as a \"fragile maternal presence, an Asian-American woman who managed to 'birth' however ambivalently, Asian-American screen women in the jazz age\". Wong's character in \"Shanghai Express\" was the subject of John Yau's 1989 poem \"No One Ever Tried to Kiss Anna May Wong\", which interprets the actress' career as a series of tragic romances. Sally Wen Mao wrote a book called Oculus, published in 2019, with a series of persona poems in the voice of Anna May Wong. In David Cronenberg's 1993 film version of David Henry Hwang's 1986 play, \"M. Butterfly\", Wong's image was used briefly as a symbol of a \"tragic diva\". Her life was the subject of \"China Doll, The Imagined Life of an American Actress\", an award-winning fictional play written by Elizabeth Wong in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 1995. In 1995, film historian Stephen Bourne curated a retrospective of Wong's films called \"A Touch of Class\" for BFI Southbank. As the centennial of Wong's birth approached, a re-examination of her life and career took shape; three major works on the actress appeared and comprehensive retrospectives of her films were held at both the Museum of Modern Art and the American Museum of the Moving Image in New York City. Anthony Chan's 2003 biography, \"Perpetually Cool: The Many Lives of Anna May Wong (1905\u20131961)\", was the first major work on Wong and was written, Chan says, \"from a uniquely Asian-American perspective and sensibility\". In 2004, Philip Leibfried and Chei Mi Lane's exhaustive examination of Wong's career, \"Anna May Wong: A Complete Guide to Her Film, Stage, Radio and Television Work\" was published, as well as a second full-length biography, \"Anna May Wong: From Laundryman's Daughter to Hollywood Legend\" by Graham Russell Hodges. Though Anna May Wong's life, career, and legacy reflect many complex issues which remain decades after her death, Anthony Chan points out that her place in Asian-American cinematic history, as its first female star,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### is permanent. An illustrated biography for children, \"Shining Star: The Anna May Wong Story\", was published in 2009. In 2016, the novelist Peter Ho Davies published \"The Fortunes\", a saga of Chinese-American experiences centered around four characters, one of whom is a fictionalized Anna May Wong, imagined from childhood until her death. In a conversation published in the 2017 paperback edition, Davies described his novel as an exploration of the Chinese-American quest for authenticity\u2014a third way of being Chinese-American\u2014with Anna May Wong representing an iconic example of that struggle. On January 22, 2020, a Google Doodle celebrated Wong, commemorating the 97th anniversary of the day \"The Toll of the Sea\" went into general release. In 2020, actress Michelle Krusiec played Wong in Ryan Murphy's Netflix drama series, \"Hollywood\". The limited series tells an alternate history of Hollywood in the 1940s. Also in 2020, her life story was told as part of PBS's documentary \"Asian Americans.\" In 2021, the United States Mint announced that Wong would be among the first women depicted on the reverse of the quarter coin as a part of the American Women quarters series. When the quarters with her depicted on them went into circulation in 2022, Wong became####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the first Asian-American depicted on American coinage. Li Jun Li has been cast in Damien Chazelle's film \"Babylon\", playing a role inspired by Wong. A biopic from Working Title Films is in development, with British actress Gemma Chan set to portray Wong.</s><s>Partial filmography. - \"The Red Lantern\" (1919) debut\u00a0\u2013 uncredited - \"Bits of Life\" (1921) - \"The Toll of the Sea\" (1922) as Lotus Flower - \"The Thief of Bagdad\" (1924) as a Mongol Slave - \"Peter Pan\" (1924) as Tiger Lily - \"A Trip to Chinatown\" (1926) as Ohati - \"Old San Francisco\" (1927) as A Flower of the Orient - \"Piccadilly\" (1929) as Shosho - \"Elstree Calling\" (1930) as Herself - \"The Flame of Love\" (1930) as Hai Tang - \"The Road to Dishonour\" (1930) as Hai Tang - \"Hai-Tang\" (1930) as Hai Tang - \"Daughter of the Dragon\" (1931) as Princess Ling Moy - \"Sh####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####anghai Express\" (1932) as Hui Fei - \"A Study in Scarlet\" (1933) as Mrs. Pyke - \"Limehouse Blues\" (1934) as Tu Tuan - \"Daughter of Shanghai \" (1937) as Lan Ying Lin - \"When Were You Born\" (1938) as Mei Lee Ling - \"Dangerous to Know\" (1938) as Lan Ying - \"King of Chinatown\" (1939) as Dr. Mary Ling - \"Island of Lost Men\" (1939) as Kim Ling - \"Bombs Over Burma\" (1942) as Lin Ying - \"Lady from Chungking\" (1942) as Kwan Mei - \"Impact\" (1949) as Su Lin - \"Portrait in Black\" (1960) as Tawny</s><s>See also. - Tsuru Aoki, Japanese-American silent film actress, married to Sessue Hayakawa - Nancy Kwan, the next famed Chinese-American Hollywood actress, from the mid-20th century - Portrayal of East Asians in Hollywood - Racism in early American film - Stereotypes of East and Southeast Asians in American media - James Wong Howe - Nell####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ie Yu Roung Ling, first modern dancer of China and fashion designer of Chinese-American descent</s><s>References.</s><s>References.:General and cited sources. - - - -. -. - - - - - - - -. - - - -. -. - -. -. - - - - -. - - - - - - - - -.</s><s>Further reading. - - - - - Sparks, Beverley N., \"Where East Meets West,\" \"Photoplay\", June 1924, p.\u00a055. - - Winship, Mary, \"The China Doll,\" \"Photoplay\", June 1923, p.\u00a034.</s>", "Anna May Wong was a pioneering Chinese-American actress who achieved international fame during the early 20th century.

Donovan is widely known for negotiating the 1960\u20131962 exchange of captured American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers and American student Frederic Pryor for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, and for negotiating the 1962 release and return of 9,703 prisoners held by Cuba after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.

James Britt Donovan was born on February 29, 1916, in the Bronx to of Harriet (n\u00e9e O'Connor), a piano teacher, and John J. Donovan, a surgeon. His brother was New York state senator John J. Donovan Jr. Both sides of the family were of Irish descent. He attended the Catholic All Hallows Institute.

In 1942, he became associate general counsel at the Office of Scientific Research and Development. From 1943 to 1945, he was general counsel at the Office of Strategic Services. In 1945, he became assistant to Justice Robert H. Jackson at the Nuremberg trials in Germany. Donovan was the presenter of visual evidence at the trial. While he prepared for the trials he also worked as an advisor for the documentary feature \"The Nazi Plan\". In 1950, Donovan became a partner in the New York-based law office of Watters and Donovan, specializing in insurance law.</s><s>Release of Gary Powers. In 1957, Donovan defended the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in what was known as the Hollow Nickel Case after many other lawyers refused. He later brought in Thomas M. Debevoise to assist him. Abel was convicted at trial, but Donovan was successful in persuading the court not to impose a death sentence. He appealed Abel's case to the Supreme Court, which in \"Abel v. United States\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### was rejected by a 5\u20134 vote. Donovan's argument was that evidence used against his client had been seized by the FBI in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren praised him and publicly expressed the \"gratitude of the entire court\" for his taking the case. In 1962, Donovan, who was lead negotiator, and CIA lawyer Milan C. Miskovsky negotiated with Soviet mediators to free captured American pilot Francis Gary Powers. Donovan successfully negotiated for the exchange of Powers, along with American student Frederic Pryor, for the still-imprisoned Rudolf Abel, whom Donovan had defended five years earlier. This negotiation and preceding events were dramatized by the 2015 historical thriller \"Bridge of Spies\", by Steven Spielberg.</s><s>Involvement in Cuba. In June 1962, Donovan was contacted by Cuban exile P\u00e9rez Cisneros, who asked him to support the negotiations to free the 1,113 prisoners of the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.

Donovan managed to create confidence with Castro, who was pleased Donovan brought his (Donovan's) teenage son with####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### him to Cuba. On December 21, 1962, Castro and Donovan signed an agreement to exchange all 1,113 prisoners for $53 million in food and medicine, sourced from private donations and from companies expecting tax concessions. Donovan had the idea to exchange the prisoners for medicine after he had found out that the Cuban medicine didn't help him with his own bursitis. By the end of the negotiations, July 3, 1963, Donovan had secured the release of 9,703 men, women and children from Cuban detention. Donovan was once again teamed up with CIA lawyer Milan C. Miskovsky on these negotiations. For his work, Donovan received the Distinguished Intelligence Medal.</s><s>Later life and death.

In June 1962, his alma mater Fordham presented Donovan with an honorary degree. In 1962, he was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in New York but lost in November 1962 to Republican incumbent Jacob K. Javits. In 1968, Donovan was appointed president of Pratt Institute.

He was a rare book collector, golfer, tennis player and gin rummy player. A collection of his papers is held at Stanford University's Hoover Library & Archives.</s><s>In popular culture. The story of the Abel trial and defense, followed by the negotiation and prisoner exchange, was the basis for the book \"Strangers on a Bridge: The Case of Colonel Abel and Francis Gary Powers\", written by Donovan and ghost writer Bard Lindeman, which was published in 1964. Several similar works would come later, but \"Strangers\" was the definitive work and was widely critically acclaimed. The book was re-released by Simon & Schuster in August 2015. In 1967, Donovan published his second book, \"Challenges: Reflections of a Lawyer-at-Large\". James Gregory played Donovan in the 1976 TV movie \"Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Spy Incident\", based on Powers' biography (written with Curt Gentry). Lee Majors played Powers. In 2006, Philip J. Bigger published a biography of Donovan, \"Negotiator: The Life and Career of James B. Donovan\"., which was re-released in paperback in January 2017.

The 1964 New York Times Best Seller repeated itself in 2015, becoming #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list for espionage books. The book has been widely acclaimed, including by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.

As a child, Cukor appeared in several amateur plays and took dance lessons, and at the age of seven he performed in a recital with David O. Selznick, who in later years became a mentor and friend. As a teenager, Cukor frequently was taken to the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### New York Hippodrome by his uncle. Infatuated with theatre, he often cut classes at DeWitt Clinton High School to attend afternoon matinees. During his senior year, he worked as a supernumerary with the Metropolitan Opera, earning 50\u00a2 per appearance, and $1 if he was required to perform in blackface. Following his graduation in 1917, Cukor was expected to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a career in law. He halfheartedly enrolled in the City College of New York, where he entered the Students Army Training Corps in October 1918. His military experience was limited; Germany surrendered in early November, and Cukor's duty ended after only two months. He left school shortly afterwards.</s><s>Career.</s><s>Career.:Early stage career. Cukor obtained a job as an assistant stage manager and bit player with a touring production of \"The Better 'Ole\", a popular British musical based on Old Bill, a cartoon character created by Bruce Bairnsfather. In 1920, he became the stage manager for the Knickerbocker Players, a troupe that shuttled between Syracuse, New York and Rochester, New York, and the following year he was hired as general manager of the newly####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### formed Lyceum Players, an upstate summer stock company. In 1925, he formed the C.F. and Z. Production Company with Walter Folmer and John Zwicki, which gave him his first opportunity to direct. Following their first season, he made his Broadway directorial debut with \"Antonia\" by Hungarian playwright Melchior Lengyel, then returned to Rochester, where C.F. and Z. evolved into the Cukor-Kondolf Stock Company, a troupe that included Louis Calhern, Ilka Chase, Phyllis Povah, Frank Morgan, Reginald Owen, Elizabeth Patterson and Douglass Montgomery, all of whom worked with Cukor in later years in Hollywood. Lasting only one season with the company was Bette Davis. Cukor later recalled: \"Her talent was apparent, but she did buck at direction. She had her own ideas, and though she only did bits and ingenue roles, she didn't hesitate to express them.\" For the next several decades, Davis claimed she was fired, and although Cukor never understood why she placed so much importance on an incident he considered so minor, he never worked with her again. For the next few years, Cukor####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### alternated between Rochester in the summer months and Broadway in the winter. His direction of a 1926 stage adaptation of \"The Great Gatsby\" by Owen Davis brought him to the attention of the New York critics. Writing in the \"Brooklyn Eagle\", drama critic Arthur Pollock called it \"an unusual piece of work by a director not nearly so well known as he should be.\" Cukor directed six more Broadway productions, then departed for Hollywood in 1929.</s><s>Career.:Early Hollywood career. When Hollywood began to recruit New York theater talent for sound films, Cukor immediately answered the call. In December 1928, Paramount Pictures signed him to a contract that reimbursed him for his airfare and initially paid him $600 per week with no screen credit during a six-month apprenticeship. He arrived in Hollywood in February 1929, and his first assignment was to coach the cast of \"River of Romance\" to speak with an acceptable Southern accent. In October, the studio lent him to Universal Pictures to conduct the screen tests and work as a dialogue director for \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", released in 1930. That year, he co-directed three films at Paramount, and his weekly salary was increased to $1,500. He made his solo director####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ial debut with \"Tarnished Lady\" (1931) starring Tallulah Bankhead. Cukor was then assigned to \"One Hour with You\" (1932), an operetta with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, when original director Ernst Lubitsch opted to concentrate on producing the film instead. At first the two men worked well together, but two weeks into filming Lubitsch began arriving on the set on a regular basis, and he soon began directing scenes with Cukor's consent. Upon the film's completion, Lubitsch approached Paramount general manager B.P. Schulberg and threatened to leave the studio if Cukor's name wasn't removed from the credits. When Schulberg asked him to cooperate, Cukor filed suit. He eventually settled for being billed as assistant director and then left Paramount to work with David O. Selznick at RKO Studios. Cukor quickly earned a reputation as a director who could coax great performances from actresses and he became known as a \"woman's director\", a title he resented. Despite this reputation, during his career, he oversaw more performances honored with the Academy Award for Best Actor than any other director: James Stewart in \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####), Ronald Colman in \"A Double Life\" (1947), and Rex Harrison in \"My Fair Lady\" (1964). One of Cukor's earlier ingenues was actress Katharine Hepburn, who debuted in \"A Bill of Divorcement\" (1932) and whose looks and personality left RKO officials at a loss as to how to use her. Cukor directed her in several films, both successful, such as \"Little Women\" (1933) and \"Holiday\" (1938), and disastrous, such as \"Sylvia Scarlett\" (1935). Cukor and Hepburn became close friends off the set. Cukor was hired to direct \"Gone with the Wind\" by Selznick in 1936, even before the book was published. He spent the next two years involved with pre-production, including supervision of the numerous screen tests of actresses anxious to portray Scarlett O'Hara. Cukor favored Hepburn for the role, but Selznick, concerned about her reputation as \"box office poison\", would not consider her without a screen test, and the actress refused to film one. Of those who did, Cukor preferred Paulette Goddard, but her supposedly illicit relationship with Charlie Cha####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####plin (they were, in fact, secretly married) concerned Selznick. Between his \"Wind\" chores, the director assisted with other projects. He filmed the cave scene for \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" (1938), and, following the firing of its original director Richard Thorpe, Cukor spent a week on the set of \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Although he filmed no footage, he made crucial changes to the look of Dorothy by eliminating Judy Garland's blonde wig and adjusting her makeup and costume, encouraging her to act in a more natural manner. Additionally, Cukor softened the Scarecrow's makeup and gave Margaret Hamilton a different hairstyle for the Wicked Witch of the West, as well as altering her makeup and other facial features. Cukor also suggested that the studio cast Jack Haley, on loan from 20th Century Fox, as the Tin Man. Cukor spent many hours coaching Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland before the start of filming \"Wind\", but Clark Gable resisted his efforts to get him to master a Southern accent. However, despite rumors about Gable being uncomfortable with Cukor on the set, nothing in the internal memos of David O. Selznick indicates or suggests that Clark####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Gable had anything to do with Cukor's dismissal from the film. Rather, they show Selznick's mounting dissatisfaction with Cukor's slow pace and quality of work. From a private letter from journalist Susan Myrick to Margaret Mitchell in February 1939: \"George [Cukor] finally told me all about it. He hated [leaving the production] very much he said but he could not do otherwise. In effect he said he is an honest craftsman and he cannot do a job unless he knows it is a good job and he feels the present job is not right. For days, he told me he has looked at the rushes and felt he was failing...the things did not click as it should. Gradually he became convinced that the script was the trouble...So George just told David he would not work any longer if the script was not better and he wanted the [Sidney] Howard script back...he would not let his name go out over a lousy picture...and bull-headed David said 'OK get out!'\" Selznick had already been unhappy with Cukor (\"a very expensive luxury\") for not being more receptive to directing other Selznick assignments, even though Cukor had remained on salary since early 1937####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####; and in a confidential memo written in September 1938, four months before principal photography began, Selznick flirted with the idea of replacing him with Victor Fleming. \"I think the biggest black mark against our management to date is the Cukor situation and we can no longer be sentimental about it...We are a business concern and not patrons of the arts.\" Cukor was relieved of his duties, but he continued to work with Leigh and Olivia de Havilland off the set. Various rumors about the reasons behind his dismissal circulated throughout Hollywood. Selznick's friendship with Cukor had crumbled slightly when the director refused other assignments, including \"A Star Is Born\" (1937) and \"Intermezzo\" (1939). Given that Gable and Cukor had worked together before (on \"Manhattan Melodrama\", 1934) and Gable had no objection to working with him then, and given Selznick's desperation to get Gable for Rhett Butler, if Gable had any objections to Cukor, certainly they would have been expressed before he signed his contract for the film. Yet, writer Gore Vidal, in his autobiography \"Point to Point Navigation\", recounted that Gable demanded that Cukor be fired####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### off \"Wind\" because, according to Vidal, the young Gable had been a male hustler and Cukor had been one of his johns. This has been confirmed by Hollywood biographer E.J. Fleming, who has recounted that, during a particularly difficult scene, Gable erupted publicly, screaming: \"I can't go on with this picture. I won't be directed by a fairy. I have to work with a real man.\" Cukor's dismissal from \"Wind\" freed him to direct \"The Women\" (1939), which has an all-female cast, followed by \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940). He also directed Greta Garbo, another of his favorite actresses, in \"Two-Faced Woman\" (1941), her last film before she retired from the screen. In 1942, at the age of 43, Cukor enlisted in the Signal Corps. Following basic training at Fort Monmouth, he was assigned to the old Paramount studios in Astoria, Queens (where he had directed three films in the early 1930s), although he was permitted to lodge at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan. Working with Irwin Shaw, John Cheever and William Saroyan, among others, Cuk####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####or produced training and instructional films for army personnel. Because he lacked an officer's commission, he found it difficult to give orders and directions to his superiors. Despite his efforts to rise above the rank of private\u2014he even called upon Frank Capra to intercede on his behalf\u2014he never achieved officer's status or any commendations during his six months of service. In later years, Cukor suspected his homosexuality impeded him from receiving any advances or honors, although rumors to that effect could not be confirmed. The remainder of the decade was a series of hits and misses for Cukor. Both \"Two-Faced Woman\" and \"Her Cardboard Lover\" (1942) were commercial failures. More successful were \"A Woman's Face\" (1941) with Joan Crawford and \"Gaslight\" (1944) about a woman suffering from suspicion with Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer. During this era, Cukor forged an alliance with screenwriters Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, who had met in Cukor's home in 1939 and married three years later. Over the course of seven years, the trio collaborated on seven films, including \"A Double Life\" (1947) starring Ronald Colman, \"Adam's Rib####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\" (1949), \"Born Yesterday\" (1950), \"The Marrying Kind\" (1952), and \"It Should Happen to You\" (1954), all featuring Judy Holliday, another Cukor favorite, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for \"Born Yesterday\".</s><s>Career.:Later Hollywood career. In December 1952, Cukor was approached by Sid Luft, who proposed the director helm a musical remake of \"A Star Is Born\" (1937) with his then-wife Judy Garland in the lead role. Cukor had declined to direct the earlier film because it was too similar to his own \"What Price Hollywood?\" (1932), but the opportunity to direct his first Technicolor film and work with screenwriter Moss Hart and especially Garland appealed to him, and he accepted. Getting the updated \"A Star Is Born\" (1954) to the screen proved to be a challenge. Cukor wanted Cary Grant for the male lead and went so far as to read the entire script with him, but Grant, while agreeing it was the role of a lifetime, steadfastly refused to do it, and Cukor never forgave him. The director then suggested either Humphrey Bogart or Frank Sin####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####atra tackle the part, but Jack L. Warner rejected both. Stewart Granger was the front runner for a period of time, but he backed out when he was unable to adjust to Cukor's habit of acting out scenes as a form of direction. James Mason eventually was contracted, and filming began on October 12, 1953. As the months passed, Cukor was forced to deal not only with constant script changes but a very unstable Garland, who was plagued by chemical and alcohol dependencies, extreme weight fluctuations, and real and imagined illnesses. In March 1954, a rough cut still missing several musical numbers was assembled, and Cukor had mixed feelings about it. When the last scene finally was filmed in the early morning hours of July 28, 1954, Cukor already had departed the production and was unwinding in Europe. The first preview the following month ran 210 minutes and, despite ecstatic feedback from the audience, Cukor and editor Folmar Blangsted trimmed it to 182 minutes for its New York premiere in October. The reviews were the best of Cukor's career, but Warner executives, concerned the running time would limit the number of daily showings, made drastic cuts without Cukor, who had departed for Pakistan to scout locations for the epic####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"Bhowani Junction\" in 1954-1955. At its final running time of 154 minutes, the film had lost musical numbers and crucial dramatic scenes, and Cukor called it \"very painful.\" He was not included in the film's six Oscar nominations. Over the next 10 years, Cukor directed a handful of films with varying success. \"Les Girls\" (1957) won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Musical or Comedy, and \"Wild Is the Wind\" (also 1957) earned Oscar nominations for Anna Magnani and Anthony Quinn, but neither \"Heller in Pink Tights\" nor \"Let's Make Love\" (both 1960) were box-office hits. Another project during this period was the ill-fated \"Something's Got to Give\", an updated remake of the comedy \"My Favorite Wife\" (1940). Cukor liked leading lady Marilyn Monroe but found it difficult to deal with her erratic work habits, frequent absences from the set, and the constant presence of Monroe's acting coach Paula Strasberg. It was reported at the time that after 32 days of shooting, the director had only 7\u00bd minutes of usable film. Footage would be discovered in the 1990's that showed at least 37 minutes####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of total footage had survived. Then Monroe travelled to New York to appear at a birthday celebration for President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, where she serenaded Kennedy. Studio documents released after Monroe's death confirmed that her appearance at the political fundraising event was approved by Fox executives. The production came to a halt when Cukor had filmed every scene not involving Monroe and the actress remained unavailable. 20th Century Fox executive Peter Levathes fired her and hired Lee Remick to replace her, prompting co-star Dean Martin to quit because his contract guaranteed he would be playing opposite Monroe. It was also reported at the time, that with the production already $2 million over budget and everyone back at the starting gate, the studio pulled the plug on the project. However, Monroe successfully renegotiated her contract from $100,000 to $500,000 with a bonus should the film be completed on time. Cukor was to be replaced by Jean Negulesco. There was limited press at the time about the project restarting and even less on Cukor being replaced. When Monroe was found dead in her home in the beginning of August, Cukor would give a high profile interview discussing Monroe's many reported problems. Two years later, Cukor####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### achieved one of his greatest successes with \"My Fair Lady\" (1964). Throughout filming, there were mounting tensions between the director and designer Cecil Beaton; Cukor was thrilled with leading lady Audrey Hepburn, but the crew was less enchanted with her diva-like demands. Although several reviews were critical of the film \u2013 Pauline Kael said it \"staggers along\" and Stanley Kauffmann thought Cukor's direction was like \"a rich gravy poured over everything, not remotely as delicately rich as in the Asquith-Howard 1937 [sic] \"Pygmalion\"\" \u2014 the film was a box-office hit which won him the Academy Award for Best Director, the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and the Directors Guild of America Award after having been nominated for each several times. Following \"My Fair Lady\", Cukor became less active. He directed Maggie Smith in \"Travels with My Aunt\" (1972) and helmed the critical and commercial flop \"The Blue Bird\" (1976), the first joint Soviet-American production. He reunited twice with Katharine Hepburn for the television movies \"Love Among the Ruins\" (1975) and \"The Corn Is Green\" (1979). At the age of 82,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Cukor directed his final film, \"Rich and Famous\" for MGM in 1981, starring Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen. In 1970, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1976, Cukor was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.</s><s>Personal life. It was an open secret in Hollywood that Cukor was gay, at a time when society was against it, although he was discreet about his sexual orientation and \"never carried it as a pin on his lapel,\" as producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz put it. He was a celebrated \"bon vivant\" whose luxurious home was the site of weekly Sunday afternoon parties attended by closeted celebrities and the attractive young men they met in bars and gyms and brought with them. At least once, in the midst of his reign at MGM, he was arrested on vice charges, but studio executives managed to get the charges dropped and all records of it expunged, and the incident was never publicized by the press. In the late 1950s, Cukor became involved with a considerably younger man named George Towers. He financed his education at the Los Angeles State College####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of Applied Arts and Sciences and the University of Southern California, from which Towers graduated with a law degree in 1967. That fall Towers married a woman, and his relationship with Cukor evolved into one of father and son, and for the remainder of Cukor's life the two remained very close. By the mid-1930s, Cukor was not only established as a prominent director, but socially as an unofficial head of Hollywood's gay subculture. His home, redecorated in 1935 by gay actor-turned-interior designer William Haines with gardens designed by Florence Yoch and Lucile Council, was the scene of many gatherings for the industry's homosexuals. The close-knit group reputedly included Haines and his partner Jimmie Shields, writer W. Somerset Maugham, director James Vincent, screenwriter Rowland Leigh, costume designers Orry-Kelly and Robert Le Maire, and actors John Darrow, Anderson Lawler, Grady Sutton, Robert Seiter, and Tom Douglas. Frank Horn, secretary to Cary Grant, was also a frequent guest. Cukor's friends were of paramount importance to him and he kept his home filled with their photographs. Regular attendees at his soir\u00e9es included Kath####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####arine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Joan Crawford and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, Claudette Colbert, Marlene Dietrich, Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, actor Richard Cromwell, Stanley Holloway, Judy Garland, Gene Tierney, No\u00ebl Coward, Cole Porter, director James Whale, costume designer Edith Head, and Norma Shearer, especially after the death of her first husband Irving Thalberg. He often entertained literary figures like Sinclair Lewis, Theodore Dreiser, Hugh Walpole, Aldous Huxley and Ferenc Moln\u00e1r. Frances Goldwyn, second wife of studio mogul Sam Goldwyn, long considered Cukor to be the love of her life, but their relationship remained platonic. According to biographer A. Scott Berg, Frances even arranged for Cukor's burial to be adjacent to her own plot at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery. The PBS series \"American Masters\" produced a comprehensive documentary about his life and work titled \"On Cukor\" directed by Robert Trachtenberg in 2000.</s><s>Death and legacy. Cukor died of a heart attack on January 24, 1983, and was interred in Grave D, Little Garden of Const####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ancy, Garden of Memory (private), Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale), California. Records in probate court indicated his net worth at the time of his death was $2,377,720. In 1983, a version of \"A Star Is Born\", considered by many to be his greatest picture, was restored to its original runtime of 181 minutes. The film was initially released at 181 minutes and received enormous critical and box office success. Finding that the length restricted the number of daily showings, the studio cut the movie to 154 minutes. Cukor believed this re-release \"butchered\" the gradual development of the Garland-Mason relationship. In 2013, The Film Society of Lincoln Center presented a comprehensive weeks-long retrospective of his work titled \"The Discreet Charm of George Cukor.\" In 2019, Cukor's film \"Gaslight\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".</s><s>Sources. - Hillstrom, Laurie Collier, \"International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers\".

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar (,, ; 28 April 1889 \u2013 27 July 1970) was a Portuguese politician and \"de facto\" dictator of Portugal from 1932 to 1968 serving as Prime Minister. Having come to power under the (\"National Dictatorship\"), he reframed the regime as the (\"New State\"), a corporatist dictatorship that ruled Portugal from 1933 until 1974. Salazar was a political economy professor at University of Coimbra. Salazar entered public life as finance minister with the support of President \u00d3scar Carmona after the 28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat. The military of 1926 saw themselves as the guardians of the nation in the wake of the instability and perceived failure of the First Republic, but they had no clue how to address the critical challenges of the hour. Within one year, armed with special powers, Salazar balanced the budget and stabilized Portugal's currency. Salazar produced the first of many budgetary surpluses. He promoted civilian administration in the authoritarian regime when the politics of more and more countries were becoming militarized. Salazar's aim was the de-politicization of society, rather than the mobilization of the populace. However, Portugal remained largely underdeveloped, its####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### population relatively poor and with low education attainment when compared to the rest of Europe. Opposed to communism, socialism, syndicalism and liberalism, Salazar's rule was conservative, corporatist and nationalist in nature; it was also capitalist to some extent although in a very conditioned way until the beginning of the final stage of his rule, in the 1960s. Salazar distanced himself from fascism and Nazism, which he described as a \"pagan Caesarism\" that did not recognize legal, religious, or moral limits. Throughout his life Salazar avoided populist rhetoric. Salazar was generally opposed to the concept of political parties when, in 1930, he created the National Union. Salazar described and promoted the party as a \"non-party\", and announced that the National Union would be the antithesis of a political party. He promoted Catholicism, but argued that the role of the Church was social, not political, and negotiated the Concordat of 1940 that kept the church at arm's length. One of the mottos of the Salazar regime was (\"God, Fatherland and Family\"), although he never turned Portugal into a confessional state. With the enabling him to exercise vast political powers, Salazar used censorship and the PIDE secret police to quell####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### opposition. One opposition leader, Humberto Delgado, who openly challenged Salazar's regime in the 1958 presidential election, was first exiled and then killed by Salazar's secret police. Salazar supported Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War and played a key role in keeping Portugal and Spain neutral during World War II while still providing aid and assistance to the Allies. Despite being a dictatorship, Portugal under his rule took part in the founding of some international organizations. Portugal was one of the 12 founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, joined the European Payments Union in 1950 and was one of the founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960, and a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1961. Under his rule, Portugal also joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1961 and began the Portuguese Colonial War. The doctrine of pluricontinentalism was the basis of his territorial policy, a conception of the Portuguese Empire as a unified state that spanned multiple continents. After Salazar fell into a coma in 1968, President Am\u00e9rico Tom\u00e1s dismissed him from the position of prime minister. Salazar's rule is widely described as dictatorial and was characterized by systematic repression####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of civil and political rights, mass torture, arbitrary arrests, concentration camps, police brutality against civil rights protestors, electoral fraud and colonial wars that left hundreds of thousands dead. The collapsed during the Carnation Revolution of 1974, four years after Salazar's death. In recent decades, \"new sources and methods are being employed by Portuguese historians in an attempt to come to grips with the dictatorship which lasted forty-eight years.\"</s><s>Background.</s><s>Background.:Family. Salazar was born in Vimieiro, near Santa Comba D\u00e3o (Viseu District), to a family of modest income on 28 April 1889. His father, a small landowner, had started as an agricultural labourer and became the manager for the Perestrelos, a wealthy family of rural landowners of the region of Santa Comba D\u00e3o who possessed lands and other assets scattered between Viseu and Coimbra. He was the only male child of two fifth cousins, Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira (1839\u20131932) and his wife Maria do Resgate Salazar (1845\u20131926). According to Portuguese naming customs, which place the mother's surname first, Salazar's name would have been \"Ant\u00f3nio Salazar de Oliveira\" \u2013 a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### pattern followed by his four sisters \u2013 but, for reasons that remain unclear, the order of his surnames was reversed, and he thus became \"Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar\". His four older sisters were Maria do Resgate Salazar de Oliveira, an elementary school teacher; Elisa Salazar de Oliveira; Maria Leopoldina Salazar de Oliveira; and Laura Salazar de Oliveira, who in 1887 married Abel Pais de Sousa, brother of M\u00e1rio Pais de Sousa, who served as Salazar's Interior Minister.</s><s>Background.:Education. Salazar attended the primary school in his small village and later went to another primary school in Viseu. At age 11, he won a free place at Viseu's seminary, where he studied for eight years, from 1900 to 1908. Salazar considered becoming a priest, but like many who entered the seminary very young, he decided not to proceed to the priesthood after receiving holy orders. He went to Coimbra in 1910 during the first years of the Portuguese First Republic to study law at the University of Coimbra. During these student years in Coimbra, he developed a particular interest in finance and graduated in law with####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### distinction, specialising in finance and economic policy. He graduated in 1914, with 19 points out of 20, and in the meantime, became an assistant professor of economic policy at the Law School. In 1917, he assumed the chairs of economic policy and finance at the university by appointment of professor Jos\u00e9 Alberto dos Reis. In the following year, Salazar was awarded his doctorate.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Background. Salazar was twenty-one years old at the time of the revolution of 5 October 1910, which overthrew the Portuguese monarchy and instituted the First Portuguese Republic. The political institutions of the First Republic lasted until 1926, when it was replaced by a military dictatorship. This was first known as the \"Ditadura Militar\" (Military Dictatorship) and then, from 1928, as the \"Ditadura Nacional\" (National Dictatorship). The era of the First Republic has been described as one of \"continual anarchy, government corruption, rioting and pillage, assassinations, arbitrary imprisonment and religious persecution\". It witnessed the inauguration of eight presidents, 44 cabinet re-organisations and 21 revolutions. The first government of the Republic####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### lasted less than 10 weeks and the longest-ruling government lasted little over a year. Revolution in Portugal became a byword in Europe. The cost of living increased twenty-fivefold, while the currency fell to a part of its gold value. Portugal's public finances entered a critical phase, having been under imminent threat of default since at least the 1890s. The gaps between the rich and the poor continued to widen. The regime led Portugal to enter World War I in 1916, a move that only aggravated the perilous state of affairs in the country. Concurrently, the Catholic Church was hounded by the anti-clerical Freemasons of the Republic and political assassination and terrorism became commonplace. Between 1920 and 1925, according to official police figures, 325 bombs burst in the streets of Lisbon. The British diplomat Sir George Rendel said that he could not describe the \"political background as anything but deplorable\u00a0... very different from the orderly, prosperous and well-managed country that it later became under the government of Senhor Salazar\". Salazar would keep in mind the political chaos of this time when he later ruled Portugal. Public discontent led to the 28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat, which was welcomed by most civilian classes. At the time, the prevailing view####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in Portugal was that political parties were elements of division and that parliamentarianism was in crisis. This led to general support, or at least tolerance, of an authoritarian regime.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Early path. As a young man, Salazar's involvement in politics stemmed from his Catholic views, which were aroused by the new anti-clerical stance of the First Republic. He became a member of the non-politically affiliated Catholic movement \"Centro Acad\u00e9mico de Democracia Crist\u00e3\" (Academic Centre for Christian Democracy). Salazar rejected the monarchists because he felt that they were opposed to the social doctrines espoused by Pope Leo XIII to which he was very sympathetic. He was a frequent contributor to journals concerned with social studies, especially the weekly \"O Imparcial\", which was directed by his friend (and later Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon) Manuel Gon\u00e7alves Cerejeira. Local press described him as \"one of the most powerful minds of the new generation\". In 1921, Salazar was persuaded to stand as a candidate for election to parliament, though he did so reluctantly. He appeared once in the chamber and never returned, struck by the disorder he witnessed and a feeling of futility. Salazar was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### convinced that liberal individualism had led to fragmentation of society and a perversion of the democratic process. After the \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" of 28 May 1926 which established the Ditadura Nacional regime, Salazar briefly joined the government of Jos\u00e9 Mendes Cabe\u00e7adas as Minister of Finance. On 11 June, a small group of officers drove from Lisbon to Santa Comba D\u00e3o to persuade him to be Minister of Finance. Salazar spent five days in Lisbon. The conditions he proposed to control spending were refused, he quickly resigned, and in two hours he was on a train back to Coimbra University, explaining that because of the frequent disputes and general disorder in the government, he could not do his work properly. Portugal's overriding problem in 1926 was its enormous public debt, much of which was owed to foreign entities. Several times between 1926 and 1928, Salazar turned down appointment to the finance ministry. He pleaded ill-health, devotion to his aged parents and a preference for the academic cloisters. In 1927, under the ministry of Sinel de Cordes, the public deficit kept on growing. The government tried to obtain loans from Baring Brothers under the auspices of the League of Nations, but the conditions were considered unacceptable####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. With Portugal under the threat of an imminent financial collapse, Salazar finally agreed to become its 81st Finance Minister on 26 April 1928 after the republican and Freemason \u00d3scar Carmona was elected president. However, before accepting the position, he personally secured from Carmona a categorical assurance that as finance minister he would have a free hand to veto expenditure in all government departments, not just his own. Salazar was the financial czar virtually from the day he took office. Within one year, armed with special powers, Salazar balanced the budget and stabilised Portugal's currency. Salazar produced the first of many budgetary surpluses in Portugal. In July 1929, Salazar again presented his resignation. His friend M\u00e1rio de Figueiredo, Minister of Justice, passed new legislation that facilitated the organisation of religious processions. The new law outraged the republicans, triggered a cabinet crisis, and Figueiredo threatened to resign. Salazar advised Figueiredo against resigning, but told his friend he would join him in his decision. Figueiredo did resign, and Salazar \u2013 at that time hospitalised due to a broken leg \u2013 followed suit on 3 July. Carmona went personally to the hospital on the 4th and asked####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Salazar to change his mind. Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Vicente de Freitas, who took issue with Carmona's policies, left the cabinet. Salazar remained in the cabinet as Minister of Finance, but with additional powers. Salazar stayed on as finance minister while military prime ministers came and went. From his first successful year in office, he gradually came to embody the financial and political solution to the turmoil of the military dictatorship, which had not produced a clear leader. Finally, on 5 July 1932, President Carmona appointed Salazar as the 100th prime minister of Portugal, after which he began to operate closer to the mainstream of political sentiment in his country. The authoritarian government consisted of a right-wing coalition, and he was able to co-opt the moderates of each political current with the aid of censorship and repression directed against those outside of it. Those perceived to be genuine fascists were jailed or exiled. Conservative Catholics were Salazar's earliest and most loyal supporters, whereas conservative republicans who could not be co-opted became his most dangerous opponents during the early period. They attempted several coups, but never presented a united front, consequently these attempts were easily repressed. Never a true monarchist, Salazar nevertheless gained most of the monarchists' support, as####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Manuel II of Portugal, the exiled and deposed last king of Portugal, always endorsed Salazar. Later, in 1932, it was due to Salazar's actions that the deposed king was given a state funeral. The National Syndicalists were torn between supporting the regime and denouncing it as bourgeois. They were granted enough symbolic concessions for Salazar to win over the moderates, but the rest were repressed by the political police.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Formation of the \"Estado Novo\". Salazar based his political philosophy on a close interpretation of the Catholic social doctrine, much like the contemporary regime of Engelbert Dollfuss in Austria. The economic system, known as corporatism, was based on similar interpretations of the papal encyclicals \"Rerum novarum\" (Leo XIII, 1891) and \"Quadragesimo anno\" (Pius XI, 1931), which were meant to prevent class struggle and transform economic concerns secondary to social values. \"Rerum novarum\" argued that labor associations were part of the natural order, like the family. The right of men to organise into trade unions and to engage in labor activities was thus inherent and could not be denied by employers or####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the state. \"Quadragesimo anno\" provided the blue print for the erection of the corporatist system. A new constitution was drafted by a group of lawyers, businessmen, clerics and university professors, with Salazar the leading spirit and Marcelo Caetano also playing a major role. The constitution created the \"Estado Novo\" (\"New State\"), in theory a corporatist state representing interest groups rather than individuals. He wanted a system in which the people would be represented through corporations, rather than through political parties, and where national interest was given priority over sectional claims. Salazar thought that the party system had failed irrevocably in Portugal. Unlike Mussolini or Hitler, Salazar never had the intention to create a party-state. Salazar was against the whole-party concept and in 1930 he created the National Union a single-party, which he marketed as a \"non-party\",  announcing that the National Union would be the antithesis of a political party. The National Union became an ancillary body, not a source of political power. The National Union was set up to control and restrain public opinion rather than to mobilize it, the goal was to strengthen and preserve traditional values rather than to induce a new social order.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### At no stage did it appear that Salazar wished it to fulfill the central role the Fascist Party had acquired in Mussolini's Italy, in fact it was meant to be a platform of conservatism, not a revolutionary vanguard. Ministers, diplomats and civil servants were never compelled to join the National Union. The legislature, called the National Assembly, was restricted to members of the National Union. It could initiate legislation, but only concerning matters that did not require government expenditures. The parallel Corporative Chamber included representatives of municipalities, religious, cultural and professional groups and of the official workers' syndicates that replaced free trade unions. The new constitution introduced by Salazar established an anti-parliamentarian and authoritarian government that would last until 1974. The president was to be elected by popular vote for a period of seven years. On paper, the new document vested sweeping, almost dictatorial powers in the hands of the president, including the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister. The president was elevated to a position of preeminence as the \"balance wheel\", the defender and ultimate arbiter of national politics. President Carmona, however, had allowed Salazar more or less a free hand since appointing him prime minister and continued to do so; Carmona and his successors would largely be####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### figureheads as he wielded the true power. Wiarda argues that Salazar achieved his position of power not just because of constitutional stipulations, but also because of his character: domineering, absolutist, ambitious, hardworking and intellectually brilliant. The corporatist constitution was approved in the national Portuguese constitutional referendum of 19 March 1933. A draft had been published one year before, and the public was invited to state any objections in the press. These tended to stay in the realm of generalities and only a handful of people, less than 6,000, voted against the new constitution.  The new constitution was approved with 99.5% of the vote, but with 488,840 abstentions (in a registered electorate of 1,330,258) counting as \"yes\". Hugh Kay points out that the large number of abstentions might be attributable to the fact that voters were presented with a package deal to which they had to say \"yes\" or \"no\" with no opportunity to accept one clause and reject another. In this referendum, women were allowed to vote for the first time in Portugal. Their right to vote had not been obtained during the First Republic, despite feminist efforts, and even in the referendum vote, secondary education was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a requirement for female voters, whereas males only needed to be able to read and write. The year 1933 marked a watershed in Portuguese history. Under Salazar's supervision, Teot\u00f3nio Pereira, the Sub-Secretary of State of Corporations and Social Welfare, reporting directly to Salazar, enacted extensive legislation that shaped the corporatist structure and initiated a comprehensive social welfare system. This system was equally anti-capitalist and anti-socialist. The corporatisation of the working class was accompanied by strict legislation regulating business. Workers' organisations were subordinated to state control, but granted a legitimacy that they had never before enjoyed and were made beneficiaries of a variety of new social programs. Nevertheless, it is important to note that even in the enthusiastic early years, corporatist agencies were not at the centre of power and therefore corporatism was not the true base of the whole system.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Formation of the \"Estado Novo\".:Relationship with fascism. In 1934, Salazar exiled Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto as a part of a purge of the leadership of the Portuguese National Syndicalists, also known as the \"camisas azuis\" (\"Blue Shirts\"). Salazar denounced the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### National Syndicalists as \"inspired by certain foreign models\" (meaning German Nazism) and condemned their \"exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader\" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the \"Estado Novo\". Salazar's own party, the National Union, was formed as a subservient umbrella organisation to support the regime itself, and therefore did not have its own philosophy. At the time, according to Kay, many European countries feared what he described as \"the destructive potential of communism\". Salazar not only forbade Marxist parties, but also revolutionary fascist-syndicalist parties. One overriding criticism of his regime is that stability was bought and maintained at the expense of suppression of human rights and liberties. The corporatist state had some similarities to Italian fascism and the original \"corporativismo\" of Benito Mussolini, but considerable differences in its moral approach to governing. Although Salazar admired Mussolini and was influenced by his Labour Charter of 1927, he distanced himself from fascist dictatorship, which he considered a pagan Caesarist political system that recognised neither legal nor####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### moral limits. Salazar also viewed German Nazism as espousing pagan elements that he considered repugnant. Just before World War II, Salazar made this declaration: Scholars such as Stanley G. Payne, Thomas Gerard Gallagher, Juan Jos\u00e9 Linz, Ant\u00f3nio Costa Pinto, Roger Griffin, Robert Paxton and Howard J. Wiarda, prefer to consider the Portuguese Estado Novo as conservative authoritarian rather than fascist. On the other hand, some Portuguese scholars like Fernando Rosas, Manuel Villaverde Cabral, Manuel de Lucena and Manuel Loff think that the Estado Novo should be considered fascist. Stanley G. Payne wrote that, \"Salazar's system might best be described as one of Authoritarian Corporatism or even authoritarian corporative liberalism\", rather than fascism. Historian Juan Jos\u00e9 Linz says that fascism never took roots in Salazar' Portugal  The Estado Novo of Portugal differed from fascism even more profoundly than Franco's Spain. Salazar was, in effect, the dictator of Portugal, but he preferred a passive public and a limited state where social power remained in the hands of the Church, the army, and the big landowners. Historian Robert Paxton observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### it was widely mimicked. He wrote, \"In fascism's heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization.\" He went on to observe that Salazar \"crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization\".</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Securing the regime. Salazar relied on secret police to enforce the policies he wished to implement. The \"Pol\u00edcia de Vigil\u00e2ncia e de Defesa do Estado (PVDE)\" (\"State Defence and Surveillance Police\") was established in 1933. It was replaced in 1945 by the remodeled \"Pol\u00edcia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado (PIDE)\" (\"International and State Defence Police\"), which lasted until 1969 (and from that year to 1974 under Marcelo Caetano, it was the \"Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Seguran\u00e7a (DGS)\" (\"General Security Directorate\")). The secret police existed not only to protect national security in a modern sense, but also to suppress the regime's political opponents, especially those associated with the international communist movement or the Soviet Union.</s><s>Politics####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and \"Estado Novo\".:Securing the regime.:Spanish Civil War. The Spanish Civil War, which began in July 1936, was the ostensible reason for the radicalisation of the regime. Internally, the regime had to face a monarchist revolt in 1935, a threatened leftist coup in 1936 and several bombs and conspiracies in 1936 and 1937, including an attempt to assassinate Salazar in 1937. At the same time, Spanish Republican agents were active in Lisbon and Spanish troops were deployed on Portugal's vulnerable border, severely threatening Portuguese sovereignty. At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Salazar took up additional portfolios as minister of war and minister of foreign affairs, while retaining direction of the ministry of finance, thus concentrating even more power in his hands. Salazar supported Francisco Franco and the Nationalists in their war against the Second Republic forces, as well as the anarchists and the communists. The Nationalists lacked access to seaports early on, so Salazar's Portugal helped them receive armaments shipments from abroad, including ordnance when certain Nationalist forces virtually ran out of ammunition. Consequently, the Nationalists called Lisbon \"the port of Castile\". Later, Franco spoke of Salazar in glowing terms in an interview in the \"Le Figaro\" newspaper####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####: On 8 September 1936, a naval revolt took place in Lisbon. The crews of two naval Portuguese vessels, The NRP Afonso de Albuquerque and the D\u00e3o, mutinied. The sailors, who were affiliated with the Communist Party, confined their officers and attempted to sail the ships out of Lisbon to join the Spanish Republican forces fighting in Spain. Salazar ordered the ships to be destroyed by gunfire. The following day, loyalty oaths became mandatory for all members of the civil service and censorship was severely tightened. Every government functionary was forced to declare that he repudiated communism. This crusade aimed to root out not only communists but also the democratic opposition. The convicted sailors from the 1936 naval revolt were the first to be sent to the Tarrafal prison camp established by Salazar in the Cape Verde Islands to house political prisoners. It was labeled the \"slow death camp\" where dozens of political prisoners (mostly communists, but also adherents of other ideologies), were imprisoned under inhumane unhealthy conditions in exceedingly hot weather and died. Historians say that 60 people died in jails for political reasons during Salazar's nearly 40-year regime. In January 1938, Salazar appointed Pedro Teot\u00f3nio Pereira as special liaison of the Portuguese government to Franco's government,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### where he achieved great prestige and influence. In April 1938, Pereira officially become a full-rank Portuguese ambassador to Spain, and he remained in this post throughout World War II. Just a few days before the end of the Spanish Civil War, on 17 March 1939, Portugal and Spain signed the Iberian Pact, a non-aggression treaty that marked the beginning of a new phase in Iberian relations. Meetings between Franco and Salazar played a fundamental role in this new political arrangement. The pact proved to be a decisive instrument in keeping the Iberian Peninsula out of Hitler's continental system.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Securing the regime.:Assassination attempt. The decisive conservatism of the regime naturally drew opposition. Em\u00eddio Santana, founder of the \"Sindicato Nacional dos Metal\u00fargicos\" (\"National Syndicate of Metallurgists\") and an anarcho-syndicalist who was involved in clandestine activities against the dictatorship, attempted to assassinate Salazar on 4 July 1937. Salazar was on his way to Mass at a private chapel in a friend's house on Barbosa du Bocage Avenue in Lisbon. As he stepped out of his Buick limousine, a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### bomb hidden in an iron case exploded only away. The blast left Salazar untouched, but his chauffeur was rendered deaf. A year later, the bishops of the country argued in a collective letter that it was an \"act of God\" that had preserved Salazar's life. The official car was replaced by an armoured Chrysler Imperial. Sought by the \"PIDE\", Em\u00eddio Santana fled to Britain, where he was arrested by British police and returned to Portugal. He was then sentenced to 16 years in prison.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:World War II. Salazar had experienced the social turmoil caused by World War I, in which Portugal participated during the period of the First Republic; World War II followed its course while he was in power. Salazar was widely praised for keeping Portugal neutral during the Second World War. From the war's very beginning in 1939, Salazar was convinced that Britain would suffer injury, but remain undefeated, that the United States would step into the conflict and that the Allies would win. The American journalist Henry J. Taylor commented, \"I found not another continental European leader who then agreed with him\".</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:World War II.:Neutrality. In####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 1934, several years before the war began, Salazar clarified in an official speech that Portuguese nationalism did not include \"the pagan ideal and anti-human to deify a race or empire\", and again, in 1937, Salazar published a book in which he criticised the Nuremberg Laws passed in 1935 in Germany, considering it regrettable that German nationalism was \"wrinkled by racial characteristics so well marked\", which had imposed \"the legal point of view, the distinction between citizens and the subject \u2013 and this at the risk of dangerous consequences\". Salazar thought, regarding World War II, that \"a German victory spelt disaster for the rule of law and for peripheral, agricultural, countries such as Portugal.\" Salazar's dislike of the Nazi regime in Germany and its imperial ambitions was tempered only by his view of the German Reich as a bastion against the spread of Communism rather than an allied nation. He had favoured the Spanish nationalist cause out of fear of a Communist invasion of Portugal, yet he was uneasy at the prospect of a Spanish government bolstered by strong ties with the Axis powers. Salazar's policy of neutrality for Portugal in World War II thus included a strategic component. The country still held colonies that Portugal could not defend from military attack. Siding with the Axis####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### would have brought Portugal into conflict with Britain, likely resulting in the loss of its colonies, while siding with the Allies risked the security of the home country on the mainland. A conflict with Britain would have been economically costly, as Portugal relied on British transports of goods from Portuguese colonies to the mainland. As the price to pay for remaining neutral, Portugal continued to export tungsten and other commodities to both the Axis (via Switzerland, partly) and the Allied countries. On 1 September 1939, at the start of World War II, the Portuguese Government announced that the 600-year-old Anglo-Portuguese Alliance remained intact, but that since the British did not seek Portuguese assistance, Portugal was free to remain neutral in the war and would do so. In an aide-m\u00e9moire of 5 September 1939, the British Government confirmed the understanding.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:World War II.:Responses. British strategists regarded Portuguese non-belligerency as \"essential to keep Spain from entering the war on the side of the Axis\". Britain recognised Salazar's important role on 15 May 1940, when Douglas Veale, Registrar of the University of Oxford, informed him that the university's Hebdomadal Council had \"un####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####animously decided at its meeting last Monday, to invite you [Salazar] to accept the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Civil Law\". In September 1940, Winston Churchill wrote to Salazar to congratulate him for his policy of keeping Portugal out of the war, avowing that \"as so often before during the many centuries of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, British and Portuguese interests are identical on this vital question.\" Sir Samuel Hoare, the British Ambassador in Madrid from 1940 to 1944, recognised Salazar's crucial role in keeping Iberia neutral during World War II, and lauded him for it. Hoare averred that \"Salazar detested Hitler and all his works\" and that his corporative state was fundamentally different from a Nazi or fascist state, with Salazar never leaving a doubt of his desire for a Nazi defeat. Historian Carlton Hayes, a pioneering specialist on the study of nationalism, was the American Ambassador in Spain during the war. He met Salazar in person and also praised him, expressing a similar opinion to Hoare's in his book \"Wartime Mission in Spain\". In November 1943, the British Ambassador in Lisbon, Sir Ronald Campbell, wrote, paraphrasing Salazar, that \"strict neutrality was the price the allies paid####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### for strategic benefits accruing from Portugal's neutrality and that if her neutrality instead of being strict had been more benevolent in our favour Spain would inevitably have thrown herself body and soul into the arms of Germany. If this had happened the Peninsula would have been occupied and then North Africa, with the result that the whole course of the war would have been altered to the advantage of the Axis.\" Sir Ronald Campbell saw Salazar as fundamentally loyal to the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. When in May 1943, in the Third Washington Conference, codenamed Trident, the conferees agreed on the occupation of the Azores (Operation Alacrity)  the British Ambassador reacted to the US State Department's suggestion as \"particularly ill-timed and incomprehensible at the present juncture\". He recalled that at the outset of the war, Salazar had remained neutral with British approval and stated that \"he [Salazar] would answer the call if it were made on grounds of dire necessity\". The British Ambassador was correct, and when in August 1943 the British requested military base facilities in the Azores, invoking the alliance, Salazar responded favourably and quickly: Portugal allowed these bases, letting the British use the Azorean ports of Horta (on the island of Faial) and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Ponta Delgada (on the island of S\u00e3o Miguel), and the airfields of Lajes Field (on Terceira Island) and Santana Field (on S\u00e3o Miguel Island). From November 1943, when the British gained use of the Azores, to June 1945, 8,689 US aircraft departed from Lajes, including 1,200 B-17 and B-24 bomber aircraft ferried across the Atlantic. Cargo aircraft carried vital personnel and equipment to North Africa, to the United Kingdom and \u2013 after the Allies gained a foothold in Western Europe \u2013 to Orly Field near Paris. Flights returning from Europe carried wounded servicemen. Medical personnel at Lajes handled approximately 30,000 air evacuations \"en route\" to the United States for medical care and rehabilitation. Use of Lajes Field reduced flying time between Brazil and West Africa from 70 hours to 40, a considerable reduction that enabled aircraft to make almost twice as many crossings, clearly demonstrating the geographic value of the Azores during the war. The British diplomat Sir George Rendell stated that the Portuguese Republican Government of Bernardino Machado was \"far more difficult to deal with as an ally during the First War than the infinitely better Government of Salazar was as a neutral in the Second\".</s>####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####<s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:World War II.:Refugees. The principal reason for the neutrality of Portugal in World War II was strategic, and within the compass of the overall objectives of the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. This modest, but complex role allowed Portugal to rescue a large number of war refugees. Portugal's official nationalism was not grounded in race or biology. Salazar argued that Portuguese nationalism did not glorify a single race because such a notion was pagan and anti-human. In 1937, he published a book entitled \"Como se Levanta um Estado\" (\"How to Raise a State\"), in which he criticised the philosophical ideals behind Nazi Germany's Nuremberg laws  In 1938, he sent a telegram to the Portuguese Embassy in Berlin, ordering that it should be made clear to the German Reich that Portuguese law did not allow any distinction based on race, and that therefore, Portuguese Jewish citizens could not be discriminated against. In the previous year, Adolfo Benarus, Honorary Chairman of COMASSIS and a leader of the Lisbon's Jewish Community, published a book in which he applauded the lack of anti-Semitism in Portugal. The honorary president of the Jewish community of Lisbon, claimed in 1937 that \"happily####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in Portugal, modern anti-Semitism doesn't exist\". In 2011, Avraham Milgram, Yad Vashem historian, said that modern anti-Semitism failed \"to establish even a toehold in Portugal\", while it grew virulently elsewhere in early 20th-century Europe. On 12 June Salazar issued instructions to the Portuguese consulates in France to provide the Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and Infanta Maria Ant\u00f3nia of Portugal Duchess of Parma with Portuguese Passports. With these Portuguese Passports the entire entourage of the royal families could get visas without creating problems to the neutrality of the Portuguese Government. This way Zita of Bourbon-Parma and her son Otto von Habsburg got their visas because they were descendants of Portuguese citizens. Following the German annexation of Austria, Otto was sentenced to death by the Nazi regime. On 13 June, Salazar had to act fast again, this time to support the Belgian royal family. Salazar sent instructions to the Portuguese Consulate in Bayonne saying the \"Portuguese territory is completely open\" to the Belgian royal family and its entourage. On 26 June 1940, four days after France's capitulation to Germany, Salazar authorised the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS-####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####HICEM) in Paris to transfer its main office to Lisbon. According to the Lisbon Jewish community, Salazar held Mois\u00e9s Bensabat Amzalak, the leader of the Lisbon Jewish community, in high esteem, and allowed Amzalak to play an important role in getting Salazar's permission for the transfer. In July 1940, the civilian population of Gibraltar was evacuated due to imminent attacks expected from Nazi Germany. At that time, Portuguese Madeira agreed to host about 2,500 Gibraltarian refugees, mostly women and children, who arrived at Funchal between 21 July and 13 August 1940 and remained there until the end of the war. Portugal, particularly Lisbon, was one of the last European exit points to the US, and a large number of refugees found shelter in Portugal. The Portuguese consul general in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, helped several, and his actions were not unique by any means. Issuing visas in contravention of instructions was widespread at Portuguese consulates all over Europe, although some cases were supported by Salazar. The Portuguese Ambassador in Budapest, Carlos Sampaio Garrido, helped large numbers of Hungarian Jews who came to the Portuguese diplomatic mission in 1944 seeking Portuguese protection. On####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 28 April 1944, the Gestapo raided the ambassador's home and arrested his guests. The ambassador, who physically resisted the police, was also arrested, but managed to have his guests released on the grounds of extraterritoriality of diplomatic legations. In 2010, Garrido was recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Following the German occupation of Hungary, in response to a request from Britain and the United States who wanted neutral countries to downgrade their diplomatic presence in Hungary, Salazar recalled Garrido and left the charg\u00e9 d'affaires, Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho in his place. Branquinho, in close coordination with Salazar, issued protective Passports to hundreds of Jewish families and risked his life renting houses and apartments to shelter and protect the refugees from deportation and murder. Branquinho saved an estimated 1,000 Hungarian Jews. Branquinho's case differs from that of Sousa Mendes in at least three respects. He was deliberately setting out to save Jews, he had the full backing of the authorities in Lisbon, and was in the heart of a Nazi regime, in 1944, when the Holocaust was at its peak, while Sousa Mendes was at Bordeaux in 1940 before the Holocaust had####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### started. Branquinho's name has been engraved in the Raoul Wallenberg-memorial at the Doh\u00e1ny Street Synagogue in Budapest, but in Portugal he remains largely unknown. Branquinho was finally recalled to Lisbon on 30 October 1944. Tom Gallagher argues that Branquinho's case has been largely overlooked, relative to Sousa Mendes, probably owing to the fact that he was coordinating his actions with Salazar and that weakens the core argument in the Sousa Mendes legend that he was defying a tyrannical superior. Gallagher argues that the disproportionate attention given to Sousa Mendes suggests that wartime history is in danger of being used in contemporary Portugal as a political weapon. Tom Gallagher is not alone in classifying as disproportionate the attention given to Sousa Mendes episode; the Portuguese historian Diogo Ramada Curto also thinks that \"the myth of an Aristides who opposed Salazar and capable of acting individually, in isolation, is a late invention that rigorous historical analysis does not confirm.\" Other Portuguese who deserve credit for saving Jews during the war include Professor Francisco Paula Leite Pinto and Mois\u00e9s Bensabat Amzalak. A devoted Jew and a supporter of Salazar, Amzalak headed####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Lisbon Jewish community for 52 years, from 1926 until 1978. In 1943, Amzalak and Leite Pinto, under Salazar's supervision, initiated a rescue mission. Francisco de Paula Leite Pinto, at that time the General Manager of the Beira Alta Railway, which operated the line from Figueira da Foz to the Spanish frontier, organized several trains that brought refugees from Berlin and other European cities to Portugal. Amzalak was also able to persuade Salazar to instruct consuls in territories under Nazi occupation to validate all passports held by Jews, even though these documents were known to be far from \"kosher\". Large numbers of political dissidents, including Abwehr personnel, sought refuge in Portugal after the plot of 20 July 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Until late 1942, immigration was very restricted. In cases in which refugees were suspected to desire not simply to pass through Portugal in transit to their destination, but rather intended to remain in the country, the consulates needed to get a previous authorization from Lisbon. This was frequently the case with foreigners of indefinite or contested nationality, stateless individuals, Russians, and Jews expelled from their countries of origin. The number of refugees who escaped through Portugal during the war has been estimated to range from####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a few hundred thousand to one million, large numbers considering the size of the country's population of about 6 million at that time. After the war, Portugal kept on welcoming and supporting refugees. In an operation organised by Caritas Portugal from 1947 to 1952, 5,500 Austrian children, most of them orphans, were transported by train from Vienna to Lisbon and then sent to the foster care of Portuguese families. Among the many refugees accepted into Portugal for political and religious asylum, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, the war-time leader of Hungary, who had participated alongside the Germans, was granted asylum status. In 1950, the Horthy family managed to find a home in Portugal, thanks to Mikl\u00f3s Jr.'s contacts with Portuguese diplomats in Switzerland. Horthy and members of his family were relocated to the seaside town of Estoril, in the house address Rua Dom Afonso Henriques, 1937 2765.573 Estoril.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:World War II.:Maintaining the regime. In October 1945, Salazar announced a liberalisation program designed to restore civil rights that had been suppressed during the Spanish Civil War and World War II in hopes of improving the image of his regime in Western circles. The####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### measures included parliamentary elections, general political amnesty, restoration of freedom of the press, curtailment of legal repression and a commitment to introduce the right of \"habeas corpus\". The regime started to organise itself around a broad coalition, the Movement of Democratic Unity (MUD), which ranged from ultra-Catholics and fringe elements of the extreme right to the Portuguese Communist Party. Initially, the MUD was controlled by the moderate opposition, but soon became strongly influenced by the Communist Party, which controlled its youth wing. In its leadership were several communists, among them Oct\u00e1vio Pato, Salgado Zenha, M\u00e1rio Soares (later President), J\u00falio Pomar and M\u00e1rio Sacramento. This influence led the MUD to be outlawed by the government in 1948 after several waves of suppression. Restrictions that had been temporarily lifted were then gradually reinstated. As the Cold War started, Salazar's \"Estado Novo\" remained rigidly authoritarian. Salazar had been able to hold onto power by virtue of the public's recollection of the chaos that had characterised Portuguese life before 1926. However, by the 1950s, a new generation emerged that had no collective memory of this instability. The clearest sign of this came in the Portuguese presidential election of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 1958. Most neutral observers believed that the candidate of the democratic opposition, Humberto Delgado, would have defeated the candidate of the Salazar regime, Am\u00e9rico Tom\u00e1s, had the election been conducted fairly. Delgado was well aware that the president's power to sack the prime minister was theoretically the only check on Salazar's power, and stated that if elected, his first policy would be to dismiss Salazar. Delgado was able to rally support from a wide range of opposition viewpoints. Among his supporters were some controversial figures, namely the press campaign manager Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto, a former Nazi sympathiser and former leader of the Blue Shirts, arrested and exiled by the regime in the 1930s. Official figures credited Delgado with one-fourth of the votes, in total approximately a million\u2013well behind Tom\u00e1s. Salazar was alarmed enough by the episode that he pushed through a constitutional amendment transferring election of the president to the two parliamentary bodies, which were both firmly under his control. Delgado was expelled from the Portuguese military and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy before going into exile. Much of his banishment was spent in Brazil and later in Algeria, as a guest of Ahmed Ben Bella. Later, in 1965, he was lured into####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### an ambush by the \"PIDE\" (the regime's secret police) near the border town of Olivenza and killed, alongside his Brazilian secretary Arajaryr Moreira de Campos. An official statement claimed that Delgado was shot and killed in self-defence, despite Delgado being unarmed; de Campos' body bore marks of strangulation.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Colonial policies. During the last years of the monarchy and of the First Republic in Portugal, an attempt was made to obtain firmer control over the claimed African possessions. One reason the government dragged itself into World War I was the defence of the African empire, considered a part of the national identity. Salazar briefly served as minister of colonies before assuming the premiership, and in that capacity he prepared the Colonial Act of 1930, which centralised the administration of the colonies in his own system and proclaimed the need to bring indigenous peoples into western civilisation and the Portuguese nation. Assimilation was the main objective, except for the Atlantic colony of Cape Verde (which was seen as an extension of Portugal), the Indian colonies, and Macau (which were seen as having their own forms of \"civilization\"). As it had been before Salazar's tenure in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the office, a clear legal distinction continued to be made between indigenous peoples and other citizens \u2013 the latter mostly Europeans, some Creole elites, and a few black Africans. A special statute was given to native communities to accommodate their tribal traditions. In theory, it established a framework that would allow natives to be gradually assimilated into Portuguese culture and citizenship, while in reality the percentage of assimilated African population never reached one percent. In 1945, Portugal still had an extensive colonial empire that encompassed Cape Verde, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe, Angola (including Cabinda), Portuguese Guinea, and Mozambique in Africa; Portuguese India in South Asia; and Macau and Timor in the Far East. Salazar wanted Portugal to be relevant internationally, and the country's overseas colonies made that possible. In 1947, Captain Henrique Galv\u00e3o, a Portuguese parliamentarian, submitted a report disclosing the situation of forced labor and precarious health services in the Portuguese colonies of Africa. The natives, it said, were simply regarded as beasts of burden. Galv\u00e3o's courageous report eventually led to his downfall, and in 1952, he was arrested for subversive activities. Although the \"Estatuto do Indigenato\" ('Indigenous Statute') set standards for####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### indigenes to obtain Portuguese citizenship until it was abolished in 1961, the conditions of the native populations of the colonies were still harsh, and they suffered inferior legal status under its policies. Under the Colonial Act, African Natives could be forced to work. By requiring all African men to pay a tax in Portuguese currency, the government created a situation in which a large percentage of men in any given year could only earn the specie needed to pay the tax by going to work for a colonial employer. In practice, this enabled settlers to use forced labor on a massive scale, frequently leading to horrific abuses. Following the Second World War, the colonial system was subject to growing dissatisfaction, and in the early 1950s the United Kingdom launched a process of decolonization. Belgium and France followed suit. Unlike the other European colonial powers, Salazar attempted to resist this tide and maintain the integrity of the empire. In order to justify Portugal's colonial policies and Portugal's alleged civilising mission, Salazar ended up adopting Gilberto Freyre's theories of Lusotropicalism, which maintained that the Portuguese had a special talent for adapting to environments, cultures, and the peoples who lived in the tropics in order to build harmonious multiracial societies. Such a view has long####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### been criticised, notably by Charles R. Boxer, a prominent historian of colonial empires. In general, the defense of the Portuguese colonial empire was consensual in Portuguese society. Most of Salazar's political opponents (with the exception of the Portuguese Communist Party) also strongly favoured colonialist policies. This was the case with Jo\u00e3o Lopes Soares (father of M\u00e1rio Soares), who had been minister of colonies, General Norton de Matos, the leader of the opposition supported by M\u00e1rio Soares and Ant\u00f3nio S\u00e9rgio, a prominent Salazar opponent. Salazar's reluctance to travel abroad, his increasing determination not to grant independence to the colonies, and his refusal to grasp the impossibility of his regime outliving him marked the final years of his tenure. \"Proudly alone\" was the motto of his final decade. For the Portuguese ruling regime, the overseas empire was a matter of national identity. In the 1960s, armed revolutionary movements and scattered guerrilla activity reached Mozambique, Angola, and Portuguese Guinea. Except in Portuguese Guinea, the Portuguese army and naval forces were able to suppress most of these insurgencies effectively through a well-planned counter-insurgency campaign using light infantry, militia, and special operations forces. However, despite####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the early military successes, Colonel Francisco da Costa Gomes quickly pointed out that there could be no permanent military solution for Portugal's colonial problem. In 1961, General J\u00falio Botelho Moniz, after being nominated Minister of Defense, tried to convince President Am\u00e9rico Tom\u00e1s in a constitutional \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" to remove an aged Salazar from the premiership. Botelho Moniz ended up being removed from his government position. His political ally Francisco da Costa Gomes was nonetheless allowed to publish a letter in the newspaper \"Diario Popular\" reiterating his view that a military solution in Africa was unlikely. In the 1960s, most of the world ostracised the Portuguese government because of its colonial policy, especially the newly independent African nations. Domestically, factions within Portugal's elite, including business, military, intellectuals and the church started to challenge Salazar and his policies. Later, despite tentative overtures towards an opening of the regime, Marcelo Caetano balked at ending the colonial war, notwithstanding the condemnation of most of the international community. The Carnation Revolution brought retreat from the colonies and acceptance of their independence, the subsequent power vacuum leading to the inception of newly independent communist states in 1975, notably the People####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####'s Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique, which promptly began to expel all of their white Portuguese citizens. As a result, over a million Portuguese became destitute refugees\u00a0\u2013 the \"retornados\".</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Colonial policies.:Goa dispute. Of the colonies remaining to Portugal at the end of World War II, Goa was the first to be lost (in 1961). A brief conflict drew a mixture of worldwide praise and condemnation for Portugal. In India, the action was seen as a liberation of territory historically Indian by reason of its geographical position, while Portugal viewed it as an aggression against its national soil and its own citizens. After India gained independence on 15 August 1947, the British and French vacated their colonial possessions in the new country. Subsequently, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru initiated proceedings to find a diplomatic solution to the Goa problem. The Portuguese had been in Goa since 1510, while an independent India had only just been established. Nehru argued that the Goans were Indians by every standard and that Goa was a colony ruthlessly administered by a racist and fascist colonial regime, \"just a pimple on the face of India\", in his famous phrase. Sal####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####azar maintained that in spite of Goa's location and the nature of Portugal's political system, it was a province of Portugal as integral to his nation as the Algarve. Salazar further asserted that Goans nowhere considered or called themselves Indians, but rather deemed themselves to be Portuguese of Goa and that Goans were represented in the Portuguese legislature; indeed, some had risen to the highest levels of government and the administration of Portuguese universities. The Goans had Portuguese citizenship with full rights, thus access to all governmental posts and the ability to earn their living in any part of the Portuguese territories. Throughout the debate between Salazar and Nehru, many Goans seem to have been apathetic regarding either position, and there were no signs in Goa of discontentment with the Portuguese regime. Reports from \"Times\" correspondents suggested that not only were the residents of Goa unexcited by the prospect of Indian sovereignty, but that even the diaspora was less energised than the Indian government was prone to suggest. Contrary to what these politically motivated sources suggest, Goa did have a vigorous and well-established anti-colonial movement led by prominent figures such as Trist\u00e3o de Bragan\u00e7a Cunha with ties to the Indian National Congress With an Indian military####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### operation imminent, Salazar ordered Governor General Manuel Vassalo e Silva to fight to the last man and adopt a scorched earth policy. Eventually, India launched Operation Vijay in December 1961 to evict Portugal from Goa, Daman and Diu. 31 Portuguese soldiers were killed in action, and the Portuguese Navy frigate NRP \"Alfonso de Albuquerque\" was destroyed, before General Vassalo e Silva surrendered. Salazar forced the general into exile for disobeying his order to fight to the last man and surrendering to the Indian Army. Support and opposition to India's action was on expected lines. Statements of support came from the Arab states, newly independent Ceylon and Indonesia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc countries. Statements deploring India's resort to force in Goa, Daman, and Diu were primarily made by countries with overseas colonies, including the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and some other Western countries notably the United States, Canada and Australia, apart from regional rivals China and Pakistan.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Colonial policies.:Aid to Rhodesia. Salazar was a close friend of Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith. After Rhodesia proclaimed its Unilateral Declaration of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Independence from Britain in 1965, Portugal supported it economically and militarily through neighbouring Portuguese Mozambique until 1975, even though it never officially recognised the new Rhodesian state, which was governed by a white minority elite. In 1975, the Mozambican Liberation Front took over the rule of Mozambique following negotiations with the new Portuguese regime installed by the Carnation Revolution. Ian Smith later wrote in his biography \"\" that had Salazar lasted longer than he did, the Rhodesian government would have survived to the present day, ruled by a black majority government under the name of Zimbabwe Rhodesia.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:International relations after World War II. Despite the authoritarian character of the regime, Portugal did not experience the same levels of international isolation as Spain did following World War II. Unlike Spain, Portugal under Salazar was accepted into the Marshall Plan (1947\u20131948) in return for the aid it gave to the Allies during the final stages of the war. Furthermore, also unlike Spain, it was one of the 12 founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, a reflection of Portugal's role as an ally against communism during the Cold War in spite of its status as the only non-democratic founder. In####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 1950, Portugal joined the European Payments Union and participated in the founding of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1961. It joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1962, and finally, Portugal signed a free trade agreement with the European Economic Community in 1972, still under the auspices of the \"Estado Novo\".</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Education and literacy rates. Although the militants of the First Republic had chosen education as one of their banner causes, the evidence shows that First Republic was less successful than the authoritarian \"Estado Novo\" in expanding elementary education.Jaime Reis & Nuno Palma, 2018. \"Can Autocracy Promote Literacy? Evidence from a Cultural Alignment Success Story\", Economics Discussion Paper Series 1805, Economics, The University of Manchester, revised May 2021.  Under the First Republic, literacy levels in children aged 7 to 14 registered a modest increase from 26% in 1911 to 33% in 1930. Under the \"Estado Novo\", literacy levels in children aged 7 to 14 increased to 56% in 1940, 77% in 1950 and 97% in 1960. Under Salazar the number of elementary schools grew####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### from 7,000 in 1927 to 10,000 in 1940. While the illiteracy rate under the twenty years of the First Republic had only dropped a modest 9%, under Salazar in twenty years, the illiteracy rate dropped 21%, from 61.8% in 1930 to 40.4% in 1950. In 1940, the regime celebrated the fact that for the first time in Portuguese History, the majority of the population could read and write. In 1952 a vast multi-pronged \"Plan for Popular Education\" was launched with the intent of finally extirpating illiteracy and putting into school every child of school age. This plan included fines for parents who did not comply, and these were strictly enforced. By the late 1950s, Portugal had succeeded in pulling itself out of the educational abyss in which it had long found itself: illiteracy among children of school age virtually disappeared. In the 1960s, Portugal founded universities in the overseas provinces of Angola and Mozambique (the University of Luanda and the University of Louren\u00e7o Marques). In 1971, it recognised the Portuguese Catholic University, and by 1973 founded several state-run universities across mainland Portugal (the Minho University, the New University of Lisbon, the University of \u00c9vora, and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the University of Aveiro). In addition, the long-established universities of Lisbon and Coimbra were greatly expanded and modernised. New buildings and campuses were constructed, such as the \"Cidade Universit\u00e1ria\" (Lisbon) and the \"Alta Universit\u00e1ria\" (Coimbra). The last two decades of the Estado Novo, from the 1960s to the 1974 Carnation Revolution were marked by strong investment in secondary and university education, which experienced one of the fastest growth rates of Portuguese education in history.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Economic policies. After the politically unstable and financially chaotic years of the Portuguese First Republic, financial stability was Salazar's highest priority. His first incursions into Portuguese politics as a member of the cabinet were during the \"Ditadura Nacional\", when Portugal's public finances were in a critical state, with an imminent threat of default since at least the 1890s. After Salazar became prime minister, he levied numerous taxes to balance the Portuguese budget and pay external debts. Salazar's first years were marked by the Great Depression and the Second World War. The first era of his rule was thus an economic program based on the policies of autarky and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### interventionism, which were popular in the 1930s as a response to the Great Depression. Under Salazar, the Portuguese budget went from insolvency to showing a substantial surplus every year from 1928. Portugal's credit worthiness rose in foreign markets and the external floating debt was completely paid. However, Portugal remained largely underdeveloped, its population relatively poor and with low education attainment when compared to the rest of Europe. Conservative Portuguese scholars such as Jaime Nogueira Pinto and Rui Ramos claim that Salazar's early reforms and policies allowed political and financial stability, therefore social order and economic growth. On the other hand, historians such as the leftist politician Fernando Rosas claim that Salazar's policies from the 1930s to the 1950s led to economic and social stagnation and rampant emigration that turned Portugal into one of the poorest countries in Europe. Throughout the 1950s, Salazar maintained the same import substitution approach to economic policy that had ensured Portugal's neutral status during World War II. From 1950 until Salazar's death, Portugal saw its GDP per capita increase at an annual average rate of 3.7%. The rise of new technocrats in the early 1960s with a background in economics and technical-industrial expertise led to a new period of economic fostering, with Portugal as####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### an attractive country for international investment. Industrial development and economic growth would continue throughout the 1960s. During Salazar's tenure, Portugal participated in the founding of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1961. In the early 1960s, Portugal also added its membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. This marked the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy. Portuguese foreign trade increased by 52% in exports and 40% in imports. The economic growth and levels of capital formation from 1960 to 1973 were characterised by an unparalleled robust annual growth rates of GDP (6.9%), industrial production (9%), private consumption (6.5%) and gross fixed capital formation (7.8%). Despite the effects of an expensive war effort in African territories against guerrilla groups, Portuguese economic growth from 1960 to 1973 under the \"Estado Novo\" created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe. In 1960, after nearly 30 years of Salazar's rule, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38% of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### end of Salazar's rule in 1968, it had risen to 48%; and in 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4% of the EC-12 average.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Religious policies. For forty years, Portugal was governed by a man that had been educated at a seminary, had received minor orders, and had considered becoming a priest. Before accepting the office of minister of finance, Salazar had been associated with several Catholic movements and had developed a very close friendship with Manuel Gon\u00e7alves Cerejeira, who in 1929 would become Cardinal-Patriarch of Lisbon. During their university years at Coimbra they shared a house, an old convent known as \"Os Grilos\". In July 1929, with Salazar acting as minister of finance, the government revoked a law that had facilitated the organisation of religious processions. Salazar presented his written resignation to the prime minister saying, \"Your Excellency knows that I never asked for anything that might improve the legal status of Catholics\". He carefully avoided adding more problems to an already troubled nation, but he could not accept the \"violation of rights already conceded by law or by former####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### government to Catholics or the Church in Portugal\". Despite his identification with the Catholic lobby before coming to power and the fact that he based his political philosophy around a close interpretation of the Catholic social doctrine, he did not implement any direct change to strengthen the presence of Catholicism in Portugal in the initial phase of his rule. He wanted to avoid the divisiveness of the First Republic, and he knew that a significant part of the political elite was still anti-clerical. Church and State remained apart. No attempt was made to establish a theocratic policy. The Church's lost property was never restored. In 1932, Salazar declared the Catholic political party (\"Centro Cat\u00f3lico\") to be unnecessary, since all political parties were to be suppressed, and he \"invited\" its members to join his own political organization, the National Union. The role of the Church should be social and not political, he argued. In reaction, Cardinal-Patriarch Cerejeira founded \"Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Cat\u00f3lica\" in 1933 and continued to agitate for political power until 1934, when Pope Pius XI told Cerejeira that he should focus on social, not political, issues. In the 1933 Constitution, Article 45 provided for freedom of public and private worship for all####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### religions, together with the right to establish Church organizations and associations in accordance with the norms of law and order. Salazar based his political theory on the doctrines of the popes and throughout the 1930s achieved great prestige in the Catholic world. In 1936, the episcopate expressed its full support for the regime in a Carta Pastoral, reaffirmed the following year by the head of the Portuguese Catholic Church. Pope Pius XII said of him: \"I bless him with all my heart, and I cherish the most ardent desire that he be able to complete successfully his work of national restoration, both spiritual and material\". In 1938, Fordham University, a university founded by the Catholic Diocese of New York, granted Salazar the Honorary Doctorate of Law. Salazar wanted to reinstate the Church to its proper place, but also wanted the Church to know its place and keep it. He made it clear when he declared, \"The State will abstain from dealing in politics with the Church and feels sure that the Church will refrain from any political action.\" In May 1940, a Concordat between the Portuguese state and the Vatican was signed. There were difficulties in the negotiations that preceded its signing; the Church remained eager to re-establish its influence, whereas####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Salazar was equally determined to prevent any religious intervention within the political sphere, which he saw as the exclusive preserve of the State. The legislation of the parliamentary republic was not fundamentally altered: religious teaching in schools remained voluntary, while civil marriages and civil divorce were retained and religious oaths were not re-established. The Bishops were to be appointed by the Holy See, but final nomination required the government's approval. The clergy were subject to military service, but in the form of pastoral care to the armed forces and, in time of war, also to the medical units.  The Church could establish and maintain private schools, but they would be subject to state supervision. The Catholic religion and morality were to be taught in public schools unless parents had requested the contrary.  Catholics who celebrated canonical marriages were not allowed to obtain a civil divorce. The law stated that \"It is understood that by the very fact of the celebration of a canonical marriage, the spouses renounce the legal right to ask for a divorce.\" Despite this prohibition, nearly 91% of all marriages in the country were canonical marriages by 1961. Pinto and Rezola argue that a key strategy Salazar used to stabilise his regime was to come to terms with the Catholic Church through the Concordat. Anti-cler####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####icalism would be discouraged and the Church would have an honored and central position in Portuguese life. The Church agreed to stay out of politics, but it did operate numerous social groups for adults and youth. The Church role became a major pillar of the New State's \"limited pluralism\". Despite this landmark agreement, Church-state relations and inter-Church relations in Portugal were not without some tensions through the 1940s. Some prominent oppositionist priests, such as Abel Varzim and Joaquim Alves Correia, openly supported the MUD in 1945 and the granting of more social rights to the workers. Abel Varzim, who had been a supporter of the regime, attacked Salazar and his claims of the Catholicism of the corporatist state, arguing that the regime was not true to Catholic social teaching as the people suffered in poverty. Varzim's newspaper, \"O Trabalhador\" (\"The Worker\"), was closed in 1948. In his personal diary he wrote: \"o estado-salazar \u00e9 quem manda na igreja\" (\"In Portugal the Salazar-State rules the church\"). Joaquim Alves Correia was forced into exile in the United States, where he died in 1951. The opposition candidate in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the 1958 presidential election, Humberto Delgado, a Roman Catholic and a dissident of the regime, quoted Pope Pius XII to show how the social policies of the regime were against the social teachings of the Church. That same year, in July 1958, Salazar suffered a severe blow from the bishop of Porto, Dom Ant\u00f3nio Ferreira Gomes, who wrote a critical letter to the Council President criticizing the restrictions on human rights and denouncing the harshness of Portugal's poverty. It was time, he said, for the Church to come out of the catacombs and speak its mind. Salazar was furious. The bishop was not formally exiled, but he decided to leave the country, and it appears that Lisbon made it clear to Rome that the bishop's presence in Portugal would not be appropriate. After the Second Vatican Council, a large number of Catholics became active in the democratic opposition. The outbreak of the colonial wars in Angola, Guinea and Mozambique \u2013 in March 1961, January 1963 and September 1964 respectively \u2013 exacerbated the divisions within the Catholic sector along progressive and traditionalist lines. The pope's decision to travel to Bombay in December 1964 to take part in the Eucharistic Congress represented for the Portuguese head of government \u2013 who saw in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### India little more than the illegal occupier of Goa since December 1961 \u2013 no less than a direct affront to the nation as a whole. On 21 October 1964, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Franco Nogueira, officially defined the visit as an \"agravo gratuito\". Directly linked with the pope's visit to India, a second event of significant importance preceded the pope's visit to Portugal: the attribution of the Golden Rose to the F\u00e1tima sanctuary on 13 May 1965. Paul VI officially announced his intention to take part in the Fiftieth Anniversary celebrations of the first reported F\u00e1tima apparition \u2013 also the twenty-fifth of the consecration of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by Pius XII \u2013 during his General Audience of 3 May 1967. From the very start, he made every effort to remove any political significance from his visit. It was effectively limited to a single day in F\u00e1tima, not Lisbon, and the pope made use of Monte Real Air Base instead of Lisbon airport, which would have given a far more official nature to the pilgrimage. Religions other than the Catholic faith had little or no expression in Portugal. Throughout the period of Salazar's \"Estado Novo\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### there was no question of discrimination against the Jewish and Protestant minorities, and the ecumenical movement flourished.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Health breakdown and removal from power. In August 1968, Salazar suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on his right hemisphere. Most sources maintain that it was caused by a fall from a chair on 3 August in his summer house in the Fort of Saint Anthony of Barra. In February 2009, there were anonymous witnesses who admitted, after some investigation into Salazar's best-kept secrets, that he had fallen in a bath instead of from a chair. After the incident, Salazar's life went on normally. Sixteen days later, Salazar admitted he felt sick and he was admitted to Hospital de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 two days later. On 16 September, he went into a coma. With Salazar incapacitated, President Am\u00e9rico Tom\u00e1s considered that the 79-year-old prime minister would die soon; on 25 September, he dismissed Salazar and replaced him with Marcelo Caetano.</s><s>Politics and \"Estado Novo\".:Death and funeral. Salazar lived for a further 23 months. After he emerged from over one month of coma and unexpectedly recovered lucidity, his intimates did####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### not tell him he had been removed from power, instead allowing him to \"rule\" in privacy until his death on 27 July 1970. Tens of thousands paid their last respects at the funeral, at the Requiem that took place at the Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery, and at the passage of the special train that carried the coffin to his hometown of Vimieiro near Santa Comba D\u00e3o, where he was buried according to his wishes in his native soil, in a plain ordinary grave next to his parents. As a symbolic display of his views of Portugal and the colonial empire, there is well-known footage of several members of the Mocidade Portuguesa, of both African and European ethnicity, paying homage at his funeral.</s><s>Writings. The Portuguese literary historian Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Saraiva, a communist and a fierce lifelong political opponent of Salazar, claimed that one who reads Salazar's \"Speeches and Notes\" is overwhelmed by the clarity and conciseness of style, the most perfect and captivating doctrinal prose that exists in Portuguese, underscored by a powerful emotional rhythm. According to Saraiva, Salazar's prose deserves a prominent place in the history of Portuguese literature, and only political barriers have deprived it of its place.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Saraiva says it is written with the clarity of the great prose of the 17th century, cleansed of all the distractions and sloppiness that often obscures the prose of the Portuguese scholars. Salazar had books published, namely (\"How to Raise a State\"), in which he criticised the philosophical ideals behind the Nuremberg laws, and (\"How to Re-erect a State\").</s><s>Evaluation. Due to Salazar's long rule, a detached evaluation of him is difficult. He is considered either a saviour of interwar Portugal and an exponent of Christian philosophy in politics, or a fascist-leaning dictator who obstructed his country's democratic evolution. In 1983, historian Tom Gallagher criticised Salazar's excessive promises, writing that \"Salazar was being deceitful when he told Ant\u00f3nio Ferro in 1938, 'I estimate that within five years every child in this country will have the opportunity to read and write.' His true policy had been revealed six years earlier when he stated categorically, 'I consider more urgent the creation of elites than the necessity to teach people how to read. Historian Neill Lochery claims Salazar was one of the most gifted men of his generation and hugely dedicated to his job and country. According to American####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### scholar J. Wiarda, despite certain problems and continued poverty in many sectors, the consensus among historians and economists is that Salazar in the 1930s brought remarkable improvements in the economic sphere, public works, social services and governmental honesty, efficiency and stability. Sir Samuel Hoare, the British Ambassador in Spain, recognised Salazar's crucial role in keeping the Iberian peninsula neutral during World War II, and lauded him. Hoare asserted that, in his 30 years of political life, he had met most of the leading statesmen of Europe, and regarded Salazar highly among those. Salazar was to him a learned and impressive thinker \u2013 part professor, part priest, part recluse of unshakable beliefs. He regarded him as ascetic, concentrated on serving his country, with an encyclopedic knowledge of Europe and indifferent to ostentation, luxury or personal gains. Hoare strongly believed in Salazar as \"being a man of one idea \u2013 the good of his country\", not wanting to endanger the work of national regeneration to which he had devoted the whole of his public life. Historian Carlton Hayes, a pioneering specialist on the study of nationalism, was the American Ambassador in Spain during World War II. He met Salazar in person and agreed with####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Ambassador Hoare. Hayes wrote that Salazar \"didn't look like a regular dictator. Rather, he appeared a modest, quiet, and highly intelligent gentleman and scholar\u00a0... literally dragged from a professorial chair of political economy in the venerable University of Coimbra a dozen years previously in order to straighten out Portugal's finances, and that his almost miraculous success in this respect had led to the thrusting upon him of other major functions, including those of Foreign Minister and constitution-maker.\" Hayes appreciated Portugal's endeavours to form a truly neutral peninsular bloc with Spain, an immeasurable contribution \u2013 at a time when the British and the United States had much less influence \u2013 towards counteracting the propaganda and appeals of the Axis. Morito Morishima, the Japanese minister in Portugal during World War II, praised Salazar in his post-war memoirs: \"It was the result of Salazar's intelligence and political ability that Japan-Portugal diplomatic relations were maintained until the end war, and Salazar who was engaged in diplomacy with his calm attitude, firm theory and judgment, sophisticated expression was still vivid to my eyes. Every time I think about my stay in Portugal, I can't stop but thinking that if Japan had had one politician \u2013 just####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### one \u2013 like Salazar, our country would have followed a different path and we would not be going through our current misfortune situation.\" Belgian diplomat Andr\u00e9 de Staercke, dean of NATO's ambassadors, who served for almost 24 years on the alliance council, developed a close and long friendship with Salazar. In his memoirs, Staercke dedicates a full chapter to Salazar and ranks Salazar, together with Churchill and Paul-Henri Spaak as one of the three greatest political leaders he has met in his life. The Portuguese literary historian, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Saraiva, a communist and a fierce lifelong political opponent of Salazar, claimed that \"Salazar was, undoubtedly, one of the most remarkable men in the history of Portugal and possessed a quality that remarkable men do not always have: the right intention.\" The Portuguese historian, scholar, and editor, A. H. de Oliveira Marques, wrote of Salazar: \"He considered himself the guide of the nation, believed that there were things which only he could do ('unfortunately there are a lot of things that seemingly only I can do' \u2013 official note published in September 1935) and convinced more and more of his countrymen of that too\u00a0... He became more and more of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a dictator, more and more inclined to deify himself and to trust others less.\" In November 1965, \"Time\" magazine said of Salazar: \"Every four years, Premier Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar preserves Portugal's image as a democracy by blowing the dust off a few selected \"opposition\" leaders and relaxing police controls just enough for a few weeks to permit them to run for Portugal's 130-seat National Assembly. There are a few cracks in the facade. The assembly functions only as a rubber stamp. The opposition candidates are usually feeble old men left over from a regime that was discredited and overthrown four decades ago, and Salazar decides what they can and cannot talk about\". The Portuguese poet, writer, and literary critic Fernando Pessoa wrote that Salazar was \"capable of governing within the limits of his area of expertise, which is financial science, but not (capable of governing) with the lack of limits of government in general\", adding that \"What is wrong, here, is not that Sr. Oliveira Salazar is Minister of Finance, which I accept is right, but that he is minister of everything, which is more questionable.\" In 2006 and 2007 two public opinion television shows aroused controversy. Salazar was elected the \"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####Greatest Portuguese Ever\" with 41 per cent of the 159,245 votes on the show \"Os Grandes Portugueses\" (\"The Greatest Portuguese\") from the RTP1 channel. He was presented by the scholar Jaime Nogueira Pinto, who described being confronted with some \"reactions of perplexity, surprise, aggressiveness and even hostility\" after having accepted the task. Salazar was also declared \"Worst Portuguese Ever\" in a public poll by the satirical debate program \"Eixo do Mal\" (\"Axis of Evil\") on the channel SIC Not\u00edcias. However, the official poll results for both of the two rounds hosted by this latter program show that the public had actually voted M\u00e1rio Soares, a major opponent of Salazar and his regime, as \"Worst Portuguese Ever\". This led to viewers expressing concerns about the reliability and seriousness of the show, with the controversy extending to the poll on the show \"The Greatest Portuguese\", which M\u00e1rio Soares called \"total nonsense from start to end\". Years previously, a survey from the channel SIC had also rated Salazar as 'The Greatest Portuguese Figure of the 20th Century'.</s><s>Evaluation.:After Salazar. Salazar saw no prospects for####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### his regime beyond his death. Nonetheless, the \"Estado Novo\" persisted under the direction of Marcelo Caetano, Salazar's longtime aide as well as a well-reputed scholar of the University of Lisbon Law School, statesman and distinguished member of the regime who co-wrote the Constitution of 1933. Caetano tried to blunt the harsher edges of the regime he helped create, but the meager reforms he was able to wring out of the hardline elements of the government did not go nearly far enough for elements of the population who wanted more freedom.

The bridge across the Tagus connecting Lisbon to Almada was named the Ponte Salazar (Salazar Bridge) upon completion. Built by the \"Estado Novo\" 6 months ahead of schedule and under budget, it was the 5th longest suspension bridge in the world and the longest outside of the US. It was then renamed \"25 April Bridge\". Salazar Stadium, a noteworthy multi-purpose stadium built in Mozambique during the \"Estado Novo\", was named after Salazar. With 1975's new government it began to degrade. It was renamed Stadium of Machava. Many places across the country (streets, avenues, squares) were named after Salazar. They were renamed since 1974, especially in district capitals. Around 20 localities still reference Salazar today. There are also some azulejos with quotes of Salazar. In popular culture, Salazar's Cake (\"Bolo de Salazar\") is the name given to a cake that Salazar used to eat sometimes. It is cheap####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and simple, perhaps with similarities to sponge cake. Kitchen cake spatulas are sometimes referred to as 'Salazar' in Portugal for their effectiveness in not leaving any residue behind. The character of Salazar Slytherin from the Harry Potter book series, created by J. K. Rowling, was based on Salazar. A wine brand called \"Terras de Salazar\" (\"Lands of Salazar\") was approved in 2011 by the national institute. It never reached the market due to the owner's economic troubles. In 2012, the City Council of Salazar's hometown Santa Comba D\u00e3o announced a brand called Memories of Salazar for a range of regional products, notably wine. It was rejected by the same institute for offensiveness and the possibility of public disorder. The mayor claimed the refusal was ridiculous and will not give up or drop the name Salazar from future brand name proposals. He is considering submitting Vineyards of Salazar, as \"memories\" of the regime could be one reason to add to the refusal.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Egon Krenz Egon Rudi Ernst Krenz (; born 19 March 1937) is a German former politician who was the last Communist leader of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) during the Revolutions of 1989. He succeeded Erich Honecker as the General Secretary of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) but was forced to resign only weeks later when the Berlin Wall fell. Throughout his career, Krenz held a number of prominent positions in the SED. He was Honecker's deputy from 1984 until he succeeded him in 1989 amid protests against the regime. Krenz was unsuccessful in his attempt to retain the Communist regime's grip on power. The SED gave up its monopoly of power some weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Krenz was forced to resign shortly afterward. He was expelled from the SED's successor party on 21 January 1990. In 2000, he was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for manslaughter for his role in the crimes of the Communist regime. After his release from prison in 2003, he retired to the small town of Dierhagen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He remained on parole until the end of his sentence in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 2006.</s><s>Early years. Krenz was born to German parents in Kolberg, then part of Nazi Germany and now in Poland. His family resettled in Damgarten in 1945 during the mass repatriations and expulsions of Germans from Poland at the end of World War II.</s><s>Political career in East Germany. Trained as a teacher and working as a journalist early in his career, Krenz joined the Free German Youth (FDJ) in 1953, as a teenager and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1955. After serving in the Volksarmee from 1959 to 1961, he rejoined the FDJ. He studied at a prestigious Communist Party staff school in Moscow for three years, became a nomenclature member and obtained a social science degree by 1967. Throughout his career, Krenz held a number of posts in the SED and the communist government. He was leader of the Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation from 1971 to 1974, and became a member of the central committee of the party in 1973. He was also a member of the Volkskammer (East Germany's legislature) from 1971 to 1990, and a member of its presidium from 1971 to 1981. Between 1974 and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 1983, he was leader of the communist youth movement, the Free German Youth. From 1981 to 1984 he was a member of the Council of State. In 1983, he joined the Politburo and became the Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport of the Central Committee; the same position Honecker had held before becoming General Secretary. He rose to supreme prominence when he became Honecker's deputy on the Council of State in 1984. Around the same time, he replaced Paul Verner as the unofficial number-two man in the SED leadership, thus making him the second-most powerful man in the country. Although he was the youngest member of the Politburo (and indeed, one of only two people elevated to full membership in that body from 1976 to 1984), speculation abounded that Honecker had tapped him as his heir apparent.</s><s>Leader of the German Democratic Republic. Following popular protests against East Germany's communist government, the SED Politburo voted to remove Honecker on 18 October 1989, and Krenz was elected as the new General Secretary of the SED Central Committee. Krenz had been approached several months earlier about ousting Honecker, but was reluctant to move against a man he called \"my foster father and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### political teacher\". He was initially willing to wait until the seriously ill Honecker died, but by October was convinced that the situation was too grave to wait for what he had called \"a biological solution\". Despite many protests, the Volkskammer elected Krenz to both of Honecker's major state posts\u2014Chairman of the Council of State and Chairman of the National Defence Council. The former post was equivalent to that of president, while the latter post made Krenz commander-in-chief of the National People's Army. For only the second time in the Volkskammer's forty-year history, the vote was not unanimous (the first was on the law on abortion); 26 deputies voted against and 26 abstained. In his first address as leader, Krenz promised to blunt some of the harsher edges of Honecker's regime and promised democratic reforms. The speech was identical to the one he had given to a closed group of the SED Central Committee; he even addressed the national audience as \"Genossen\" (comrades)\u2013a term reserved for members of the SED. The speech sounded formulaic, and few East Germans believed him. For instance, they still remembered that after the Tiananmen Square massacre####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### just months earlier, he had gone to China to thank Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the regime. In Honecker's resignation speech, he named Krenz as his successor, further conveying an impression of undemocratic intransigence. For this and other reasons, Krenz was almost as detested as Honecker had been; one popular joke suggested that the only difference between them was that Krenz still had a gallbladder. Indeed, almost as soon as he took power, thousands of East Germans took to the streets to demand his resignation. Also on the same day he took office, Krenz received a top secret report from planning chief Gerhard Sch\u00fcrer that showed the depths of East Germany's economic crisis. It showed that East Germany did not have enough money to make payments on the massive foreign loans that propped up the economy, and it was now DM123\u00a0billion in debt. Although Krenz had been the number-two man in the administration, Honecker had kept the true state of the economy a secret from him. Krenz was forced to send Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski to beg West Germany for a short-term loan to make interest payments. However, West Germany was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### unwilling to even consider negotiations until the SED abandoned power and allowed free elections\u2014something that Krenz was unwilling to concede. This was not the only evidence that Krenz did not intend to truly open up the regime. While publicly discussing such reforms as loosening travel restrictions, he also personally ordered the rejection of the dissident group New Forum's application to become an approved organisation. Ahead of the large Alexanderplatz demonstration on 4 November, he ordered the Stasi to prevent any unauthorised attempt to cross the border by \"bodily violence\". On 7 November, Krenz approved the resignation of Prime Minister Willi Stoph and his entire cabinet along with two-thirds of the Politburo. However, the Central Committee unanimously re-elected Krenz to the position of General Secretary. In a speech, Krenz attempted a reckoning with history, which also criticised his political mentor Honecker. Yet, by this stage, events were rapidly spiralling out of his control. Despite promises of reform, public opposition to the regime continued to grow. In an attempt to stem the tide, Krenz authorised the reopening of the border with Czechoslovakia, which had been sealed to prevent East Germans from fleeing to West Germany. The newly####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### formed Politburo agreed to adopt new regulations for trips to the West by way of a Council of Ministers resolution.</s><s>Opening of the Berlin Wall. On 6 November, the Interior Ministry published a draft of new travel regulations. While branded as a major change, in truth the draft made only cosmetic changes to Honecker-era rules. While state offices were supposed to approve applications \"quickly\", it actually took up to 30 days to process applications for ordinary travel abroad and up to six months for emigration. Not only could applications be denied for the usual reasons (national security, public order, public health, public morals, etc.) but it made no guarantee that people travelling abroad would get access to foreign currency. The draft enraged ordinary citizens, and was denounced as \"complete trash\" by West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper. In a case of particularly bad timing, the draft was published just days after the government allowed travel to Czechoslovakia to resume. This resulted in a flood of refugees crowding onto the steps of the West German embassy in Prague. The enraged Czechoslovaks gave their East German counterparts an ultimatum: unless the matter was dealt with at once, Prague would have to seriously consider sealing off the East German-Czechoslovak border. At####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a Politburo meeting on 7 November, it was decided to enact the section of the draft travel regulations addressing permanent emigration immediately. Initially, the Politburo planned to create a special border crossing near Schirnding specifically for this emigration. The Interior and Stasi bureaucrats charged with crafting the new text, however, concluded this was not feasible, and crafted a new text relating to both emigration and temporary travel. It stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips, and also allowed for permanent emigration between all border crossings\u2014including those between East and West Berlin. The new text was completed on 9 November. However, no one briefed the Politburo's \"de facto\" spokesman, East Berlin party boss G\u00fcnter Schabowski, that the regulations were going to come into effect the following afternoon. Thus, at the daily press conference, when a reporter asked when the regulations would come into force, Schabowski assumed they were already in effect and replied, \"As far as I know\u2014immediately, without delay.\" Excerpts from the press conference aired on West German television, which was viewable in most of East Germany. This prompted a mass exodus to the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Berlin Wall by thousands of East Berliners, believing the statement to be a decision to open the border crossings at the Wall. Krenz and the rest of the leadership were unwilling to order the use of deadly force. Finally, the unprepared and outnumbered border guards, on their own authority, let the crowds pass into West Berlin. The fall of the Berlin Wall destroyed Krenz and the SED politically. On 18 November, Krenz swore in a new coalition government. Instead of an oath, it consisted of a simple handshake. However, it was obvious that the SED was living on borrowed time. The CDU and the LDPD, long subservient to the SED, threw out their pro-Communist leaderships and announced that they were leaving the National Front. The new CDU Presidium, under the leadership of Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re, also demanded the resignation of Krenz as chairman of the Council of State and Chairman of the National Defense Council. On 1 December, the Volkskammer significantly amended the East German constitution to purge it of its Communist character. Most notably, Article One, which declared East Germany to be a socialist state under the leadership of the SED, was deleted. Two days later, the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### entire Politburo and Central Committee\u2014including Krenz\u2014resigned and a working committee took over direction of the party. On 6 December 1989, Krenz resigned from his remaining leadership posts. He was succeeded as head of state by LDPD leader Manfred Gerlach. In a bid to rehabilitate itself ahead of East Germany's first free election, the successor organisation to the SED, the Party of Democratic Socialism, expelled Krenz and several other former leaders of the Communist regime in 1990. After leaving politics, he worked as a dishwasher, hospital orderly, janitor, construction worker and waste collector.</s><s>Trial and imprisonment. In 1997, Krenz was sentenced to six-and-a-half years' imprisonment for Cold War crimes, specifically manslaughter of four Germans attempting to escape East Germany over the Berlin Wall. He was also charged with electoral fraud, along with other criminal offences. He appealed, arguing that the legal framework of the newly reunited German state did not apply to events that had taken place in the former East Germany. Krenz also argued that the prosecution of former East German officials was a breach of a personal agreement given by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev during their talks,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### which led to German reunification. However, the verdict was upheld in 1999. Krenz reportedly described his conviction as \"victor's justice\" and \"cold war in court\", saying, \"The victorious power is avenging itself on the representatives of the defeated power\" (\"Die siegreiche Macht r\u00e4cht sich an den Vertretern der besiegten Macht\"). Krenz began serving his sentence in Hakenfelde Prison shortly thereafter, working in the prison laundry. He was later transferred to Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison, a prison with stricter rules, where he worked in the prison laundry and as an inmate orderly.  Krenz's application to the European Court of Human Rights on alleged misuse of East German criminal laws reached the Grand Chamber, but was rejected in 2001. He was released from prison in December 2003 after serving nearly four years of his sentence, and quietly retired with his wife Erika (1939\u20132017) to Dierhagen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He remained on parole until the end of his sentence in 2006.</s><s>Life after prison. Krenz currently lives in Dierhagen, a town on the Baltic Sea coast in Mecklenburg-####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####Vorpommern. Unlike other high-ranking former members of the SED, such as G\u00fcnter Schabowski and G\u00fcnther Kleiber, Krenz still defends the former East Germany and maintains he has not changed his political views. Krenz is fluent in Russian and has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin, saying \"After weak presidents like Gorbachev and Yeltsin, it is a great fortune for Russia that it has Putin\", while believing that the Cold War never ended. He is a Russophile and has implied that he is a popular emblem of Ostalgie. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he has expressed his support for Russia and his opposition to Germany and other Western countries sending weapons to Ukraine. Furthermore, he has called for an end to all sanctions against Russia.</s>", "Egon Krenz was a politician in East Germany who served as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) from 1989 until 1990.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Heinrich Harrer Heinrich Harrer (; 6 July 1912 \u2013 7 January 2006) was an Austrian mountaineer, sportsman, geographer, \"Oberscharf\u00fchrer\" in the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS), and author. He was a member of the four-man climbing team that made the first ascent of the North Face of the Eiger, the \"last problem\" of the Alps. While on expedition in the Indian Himalayas, Harrer and his group were arrested by British forces due to the World War 2 onset and escaped to Tibet until 1951, never seeing active combat. He wrote the books \"Seven Years in Tibet\" (1952) and \"The White Spider\" (1959).</s><s>Early life. Heinrich Harrer was born 6 July 1912 in H\u00fcttenberg, Austria, in the district of Sankt Veit an der Glan in the state of Carinthia. His father, Josef Harrer, was a postal worker. From 1933 to 1938, Harrer studied geography and sports at the Karl-Franzens University in Graz. Harrer became a member of the traditional student corporation ATV Graz. In 1935, Harrer was designated to participate in the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Alpine skiing competition at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The Austrian Alpine skiing team, however, boycotted the event due to a conflict regarding the skiing instructors' status as professionals. As a result, Harrer did not participate. In 1937, Harrer won the downhill event at the World Student Championships at Zell am See.</s><s>Eiger North Face. Mountain climbing was Harrer's true passion. Knowing an extraordinary feat of climbing could win him a place on a Himalayan expedition, Harrer and a friend, Fritz Kasparek, resolved to be the first to climb the North Face of the Eiger (3,967 m, 13,025\u00a0ft) in Switzerland. The near vertical wall, with its ice-field known as The White Spider, had claimed several lives; and the Bernese authorities even banned climbing it. Following his final university exams in July 1938, Harrer and Kasparek traveled to Kleine Scheidegg at the foot of the Eiger and set out on their climb. Halfway up the mountain, Harrer and Kasparek encountered another team making the attempt, Ludwig V\u00f6rg and Anderl Heckmair from Germany. The four decided to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### make the rest of the climb as a single team, with the experienced Heckmair leading. Throughout the climb, the four men were constantly threatened by snow avalanches and rock falls. They were caught in an avalanche as they climbed the White Spider on the upper face, but all possessed sufficient strength to resist being swept off the face. The members successfully reached the summit at four o'clock in the afternoon 24 July 1938. This first ascent of the Eiger North Face was described by Italian climber Reinhold Messner as \"a glorious moment in the history of mountaineering and a great sensation, since several climbers had previously perished on the Face\", made headlines around the world, and is recounted in Harrer's book \"The White Spider\", published in 1959.</s><s>Nazi involvement. In 1996, ORF editor and filmmaker Gerald Lehner found in American archives the membership card of Harrer, who joined the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) in October 1933. After the \"Anschluss\" of March 1938, as Germany annexed Austria, he joined the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) on 1 April. He held the rank of \"Oberscharf\u00fchrer\" (Sergeant), and on 1 May he####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### became a member of the Nazi Party. After their ascent of the Eiger North Face, the four climbers were received by and photographed with Adolf Hitler. Harrer later said he wore his SS uniform only once, on the day of his marriage to Charlotte Wegener, daughter of the eminent explorer and scholar Alfred Wegener. After returning to Europe in 1952, Harrer was cleared of any pre-war crimes and this was later supported by Simon Wiesenthal. In his memoir, \"Beyond Seven Years in Tibet\", Harrer called his involvement with the Nazi Party a mistake made in his youth, when he had not yet learned to think for himself.</s><s>Internment in India. In 1939, Harrer joined a four-man expedition, led by Peter Aufschnaiter, to the Diamir Face of the Nanga Parbat with the aim of finding an easier route to the peak. Having concluded that the face was viable, the four mountaineers were in Karachi, India at the end of August, waiting for a freighter to take them home. The ship being long overdue, Harrer, Ludwig, and Hans Lobenhoffer tried to reach Persia (Iran), but several hundred kilometres north-west of Karachi they were arrested by British soldiers as####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### enemy aliens and escorted back to Karachi, where Aufschnaiter had stayed. Two days later, war was declared, and on 3 September 1939 all were put behind barbed wire to be transferred to a detention camp at Ahmednagar near Bombay. They considered escaping to Portuguese Goa, but when further transferred to Dehradun to be detained there for years with 1,000 other enemy aliens, they found Tibet more promising, the final goal being the Japanese front in Burma or China. Aufschnaiter and Harrer escaped and were re-captured a number of times before finally succeeding. On 29 April 1944, Harrer and six others, including Rolf Magener and Heins von Have (disguised as British officers), Aufschnaiter, the Salzburger Bruno Treipel (aka Treipl) and the Berliners Hans Kopp and Sattler (disguised as native Indian workers), walked out of the camp. Magener and von Have took the train to Calcutta and from there found their way to the Japanese army in Burma. The others headed for the closest border via Landour. After Sattler gave up on 10 May, the remaining four entered Tibet on 17 May 1944,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### crossing the Tsang Chok-la Pass (5,896 m, 19,350\u00a0ft) and thereafter split into two groups: Harrer and Kopp, Aufschnaiter and Treipel. On 17 June, Treipel, exhausted, bought himself a horse and rode back to the lowlands. Several months later, when the remaining three were still without visas for Tibet, Kopp also gave up and left for Nepal (where he was handed over to the British authorities within a few days).</s><s>Seven years in Tibet. Aufschnaiter and Harrer, helped by the former's knowledge of the Tibetan language, proceeded to Tibet's capital city, Lhasa, which they reached on 15 January 1946 (eight months after Nazi Germany's surrender), having crossed Western Tibet, the South-West with Gyirong County, and the Northern Changthang. In 1948, Harrer became a salaried official of the Tibetan government, translating foreign news and acting as the Court photographer. Harrer first met the 14th Dalai Lama when he was summoned to the Potala Palace and asked to make a film about ice skating, which Harrer had introduced to Tibet. Harrer built a cinema for him, with a projector run####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### off a Jeep engine. Harrer soon became the Dalai Lama's tutor in English, geography, and some science, and Harrer was astonished at how fast his pupil absorbed the Western world's knowledge. They shared the same birthday and a strong friendship developed between the two that would last the rest of Harrer's life. In 1952, Harrer returned to Austria where he documented his experiences in the books \"Seven Years in Tibet\" (1952) and \"Lost Lhasa\" (1953). \"Seven Years in Tibet\" was translated into 53 languages, and was a bestseller in the United States in 1954, selling three million copies. The book was the basis of two films of the same title, the first in 1956 and the second in 1997, starring Brad Pitt in the role of Harrer. In \"Seven Years in Tibet\", Harrer wrote:</s><s>Later adventures. Following his return from Tibet, Harrer settled down in Kitzb\u00fchel, Austria, and later in Liechtenstein. He took part in a number of ethnographic as well as mountaineering expeditions to Alaska, the Andes, and the Mountains of the Moon in central Africa. In 1953 he explored the source of the Amazon River and made a first ascent of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Ausangate (6384 m). In 1954, some with German-American Fred Beckey, Harrer made the first ascents of Mount Deborah (3,761 m, 12,339\u00a0ft), Mount Hunter (4,442 m, 14,573\u00a0ft), and Mount Drum (3661 m), all in Alaska. In 1957, he explored the Congo River with the former king Leopold III of Belgium. In February 1962, he was the leader of the team of four climbers who made the first ascent of the Carstensz Pyramid (4,884 m, 16,024\u00a0ft; later named Puncak Jaya) on Papua, Indonesia, the highest peak in Oceania and one of the Seven Summits. This and his pioneering expedition to reach the Neolithic stone axe quarries at Ya-Li-Me are recorded in his memoir \"I Come from the Stone Age\". In 1966, he met the Xingu Indians of Brazil's Mato Grosso. In 1972, Harrer crossed the island of Borneo. He also made expeditions to Nepal, French Guiana, Greenland, Sudan, India, Ladakh, Andaman Islands, Uganda, Kenya and Bhutan. Harrer wrote more than 20 books####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### about his adventures, some including photographs considered to be among the best records of traditional Tibetan culture. Harrer was also an excellent golfer, winning Austrian national championships in 1958 and 1970.</s><s>Private life. In December 1938, Harrer married Lotte Wegener (1920\u20131989), the daughter of Alfred Wegener, German polar researcher and originator of the theory of continental drift. Her father had died on a Greenland expedition when she was 10. Their son Peter Harrer was born in December 1939, three months after Harrer had been interned by British forces in India. Their marriage was dissolved in 1943 while he was still in India. In 1953, he married Margaretha Truxa (divorce in 1958), and in 1962 he married Katharina (Carina) Haarhaus (1922\u20132014), who remained his wife until his death.</s><s>Final years. In the early 1980s, he visited Tibet again, and wrote a sequel to \"Seven Years in Tibet\", titled \"Return to Tibet: Tibet After the Chinese Occupation\". The Kirkus Review of his sequel said: He later wrote his autobiography published in English as \"Beyond Seven Years in Tibet\" in 2007. He made approximately 40 documentary films and founded the in H\u00fctt####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####enberg, Austria dedicated to Tibet. In October 2002, the Dalai Lama presented Harrer with the International Campaign for Tibet's Light of Truth Award for his efforts to bring the situation in Tibet to international attention.

After an early round defeat at the World Matchplay Championship, S\u00f6renstam finished sixth at the Evian Masters, 16th at the Women's British Open and ninth in the Swedish tournament she hosts on the Ladies European Tour. }} }} Declaring herself recovered from injury and ready to return to a complete season of competitive golf in 2008, S\u00f6renstam opened the year at the SBS Open at Turtle Bay where she captured her 70th LPGA Tour victory and first since September 2006. In 2008, S\u00f6renstam was highly critical of other female golfers who tried to play in the PGA Tour \u2013 her comments to Michelle Wie for playing on the men's tour: \"I really don't know why Michelle continues to do this. We have a major this week and, if you can't qualify for a major, I don't see any reason why you should play with the men.\" }}</s><s>Professional career.:Retirement. On 13 May 2008, S\u00f6renstam announced at a press conference at the Sybase Classic that she would \"step away\" from competitive golf at the conclusion of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 2008 season. That night, she threw out the first pitch of the Washington Nationals/New York Mets baseball game at Shea Stadium in New York and the following day read the Top Ten on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". Her last tournament victory came in a playoff at the Suzhou Taihu Ladies Open, an event co-sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour and the Ladies Asian Golf tour. Her last scheduled tournament on the LPGA Tour was the season-ending ADT Championship in November, where she failed to make the weekend play in the event's unique playoff structure. Her final sanctioned LPGA appearance was as the winning captain of Team International at the 2008 Lexus Cup in Singapore. Her last professional tournament was the Dubai Ladies Masters on the Ladies European Tour in December 2008, where she finished tied for 7th.</s><s>Professional career.:Solheim Cup captaincy. At the 2013 Solheim Cup at the Colorado Golf Club in Parker, Colorado, United States, S\u00f6renstam participated as a non-playing assistant captain, selected by European Team captain Liselotte Neumann. During the match, an incident with S\u00f6renstam involved, occurred. The Americans accused S\u00f6renstam of telling a European caddie that####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### European player Jodi Ewart Shadoff should concede a putt for par to Paula Creamer, so it could not show teammate Lexi Thompson the line for a coming putt. By the rules, only the captain were allowed to give advice to players during the competition. In the end, the 2013 match became an 18\u201310 triumph for the European team, winning on American soil for the first time and defending the cup for the first time. For the 2015 Solheim Cup at Golf Club St. Leon-Rot, Germany, S\u00f6renstam again was appointed an assistant captain by a Swedish European Team captain, this time Carin Koch. Two controversies with S\u00f6renstam involved, given a lot of public attention, occurred during the match. The second day afternoon four-ball match between Suzann Pettersen and Charley Hull for Europe against Alison Lee and Brittany Lincicome, United States, was all square, when Lee missed a putt to win the 17th hole. Taking for granted that the next 18-inch putt was conceded, Lee picked up her ball. However, Pettersen pointed out that it was not conceded, and the Europeans won the hole. Koch and S\u00f6renstam tried to convince Pettersen####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to change her mind and concede the putt, but as it was a fact that Lee had picked up her ball without the putt being given to her, it was not a possibility within the rules of golf, for the players to agree on the outcome of the hole and change the sequence of events afterwards. Pettersen/Hull eventually won the match. Later during the 2015 Solheim Cup, after Koch and S\u00f6renstam was seen in a discussion with U.S. captain Juli Inkster, S\u00f6renstam explained that she was accused of giving advice, which she strongly denied. The 2015 match ended in a U.S. win 14\u201313, after a strong American come-back the last day, said to have been inspired by the incident with the not conceded putt. S\u00f6renstam was appointed captain of the 2017 European Solhem Cup team. The match, played at Des Moines Golf and Country Club, Iowa, United States, was won by the U.S. team 16\u201311.</s><s>Professional career.:Comeback as a senior.

Dubois was taken the full distance for the first time by veteran Kevin Johnson in October 2018, winning on points after ten rounds, and beat Richard Lartey in the fourth round in April 2019. In July 2019, he beat Nathan Gorman by knockout in the fifth round to improve his record to 12 wins, 11 by stoppage, and win the vacant British heavyweight title####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. Boxing journalist Steve Bunce said he \u201c...fought like an old, seasoned bruiser, his feet flawless, his jab a stiff weapon inherited from relics of the ring\".

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Robert Louis Stevenson Robert Louis Stevenson (born Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson; 13 November 1850 \u2013 3 December 1894) was a Scottish novelist, essayist, poet and travel writer. He is best known for works such as \"Treasure Island\", \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\", \"Kidnapped\" and \"A Child's Garden of Verses\". Born and educated in Edinburgh, Stevenson suffered from serious bronchial trouble for much of his life, but continued to write prolifically and travel widely in defiance of his poor health. As a young man, he mixed in London literary circles, receiving encouragement from Andrew Lang, Edmund Gosse, Leslie Stephen and W.\u00a0E.\u00a0Henley, the last of whom may have provided the model for Long John Silver in \"Treasure Island\". In 1890, he settled in Samoa where, alarmed at increasing European and American influence in the South Sea islands, his writing turned away from romance and adventure fiction toward a darker realism. He died of a stroke in his island home in 1894 at age 44. A celebrity in his lifetime, Stevenson's critical reputation has fluctuated since his death, though today his works are held in general acclaim. In 2018, he was ranked, just behind Charles####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Dickens, as the 26th-most-translated author in the world.</s><s>Family and education.</s><s>Family and education.:Childhood and youth. Stevenson was born at 8 Howard Place, Edinburgh, Scotland, on 13 November 1850 to Thomas Stevenson (1818\u20131887), a leading lighthouse engineer, and his wife, Margaret Isabella (born Balfour, 1829\u20131897). He was christened Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson. At about age 18, he changed the spelling of \"Lewis\" to \"Louis\", and he dropped \"Balfour\" in 1873. Lighthouse design was the family's profession; Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was the civil engineer Robert Stevenson, and Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) Alan and David were in the same field. Thomas's maternal grandfather Thomas Smith had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were gentry, tracing their lineage back to Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of Inchrye in Fife in the fifteenth century. His mother's father Lewis Balfour (1777\u20131860) was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton, and her siblings included physician George William Balfour####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. \"Now I often wonder what I inherited from this old minister,\" Stevenson wrote. \"I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them.\" Lewis Balfour and his daughter both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates for their health. Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when the family moved to a damp, chilly house at 1 Inverleith Terrace in 1851. The family moved again to the sunnier 17 Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was 11. Illness was a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin. Contemporaneous views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was bronchiectasis or even sarcoidosis. Stevenson's parents were both devout Presbyterians, but the household was not strict in its adherence to Calvinist principles. His nurse Alison Cunningham (known as Cummy) was more fervently religious####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. Her mix of Calvinism and folk beliefs were an early source of nightmares for the child, and he showed a precocious concern for religion. But she also cared for him tenderly in illness, reading to him from John Bunyan and the Bible as he lay sick in bed and telling tales of the Covenanters. Stevenson recalled this time of sickness in \"The Land of Counterpane\" in \"A Child's Garden of Verses\" (1885), dedicating the book to his nurse. Stevenson was an only child, both strange-looking and eccentric, and he found it hard to fit in when he was sent to a nearby school at age 6, a problem repeated at age 11 when he went on to the Edinburgh Academy; but he mixed well in lively games with his cousins in summer holidays at Colinton. His frequent illnesses often kept him away from his first school, so he was taught for long stretches by private tutors. He was a late reader, learning at age 7 or 8, but even before this he dictated stories to his mother and nurse, and he compulsively wrote stories throughout his childhood. His father was proud of this interest; he had also written stories in his spare time until his own father found them and told him to \"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####give up such nonsense and mind your business.\" He paid for the printing of Robert's first publication at 16, entitled \"The Pentland Rising: A Page of History, 1666\". It was an account of the Covenanters' rebellion which was published in 1866, the 200th anniversary of the event.</s><s>Family and education.:Education. In September 1857, when he was six years old, Stevenson went to \"Mr Henderson's School\" in India Street, Edinburgh, but because of poor health stayed only a few weeks and did not return until October 1859, aged eight. During his many absences, he was taught by private tutors. In October 1861, aged ten, he went to Edinburgh Academy, an independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English boarding school at Spring Grove in Isleworth in Middlesex (now an urban area of West London). In October 1864, following an improvement to his health, the 13-year-old was sent to Robert Thomson's private school in Frederick Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university. In November 1867, Stevenson entered the University of Edinburgh to study engineering. He showed####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### from the start no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures. This time was more important for the friendships he made with other students in The Speculative Society (an exclusive debating club), particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevenson's financial agent, and with a professor, Fleeming Jenkin, whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write. Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (known as \"Bob\"), a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art. Each year during the holidays, Stevenson travelled to inspect the family's engineering works: to Anstruther and Wick in 1868, with his father on his official tour of Orkney and Shetland islands lighthouses in 1869, and for three weeks to the island of Erraid in 1870. He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest. The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of Walter Scott with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scott's 1822 novel \"The Pirate\". In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### pursue a life of letters. Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevenson's mother reported that he was \"wonderfully resigned\" to his son's choice. To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read law (again at Edinburgh University) and be called to the Scottish bar. In his 1887 poetry collection \"Underwoods\", Stevenson muses on his having turned from the family profession: Say not of me that weakly I declined The labours of my sires, and fled the sea, The towers we founded and the lamps we lit, To play at home with paper like a child. But rather say: \"In the afternoon of time\" \"A strenuous family dusted from its hands\" \"The sand of granite, and beholding far\" \"Along the sounding coast its pyramids\" \"And tall memorials catch the dying sun,\" \"Smiled well content, and to this childish task\" \"Around the fire addressed its evening hours.\"</s><s>Family and education.:Rejection of church dogma. In other respects too, Stevenson was moving away from his upbringing. His dress became more Bohemian; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a velveteen jacket and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress. Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels. More significantly, he had come to reject Christianity and declared himself an atheist. In January 1873, when he was 22, his father came across the constitution of the LJR (Liberty, Justice, Reverence) Club, of which Stevenson and his cousin Bob were members, which began: \"Disregard everything our parents have taught us\". Questioning his son about his beliefs, he discovered the truth. Stevenson no longer believed in God and had grown tired of pretending to be something he was not: \"am I to live my whole life as one falsehood?\" His father professed himself devastated: \"You have rendered my whole life a failure.\" His mother accounted the revelation \"the heaviest affliction\" to befall her. \"O Lord, what a pleasant thing it is\", Stevenson wrote to his friend Charles Baxter, \"to have just damned the happiness of (probably) the only two people who care a damn about you in the world.\" Stevenson's rejection of the Presbyterian Church and Christian dogma, however, did not turn into lifelong atheism or agnosticism. On February 15, 1878, the 27-year-old wrote to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### his father and stated: Stevenson did not resume attending church in Scotland. However, he did teach Sunday School lessons in Samoa, and prayers he wrote in his final years were published posthumously.</s><s>Family and education.:\"An Apology for Idlers\". Justifying his rejection of an established profession, in 1877 Stevenson offered \"An Apology for Idlers\". \"A happy man or woman\", he reasoned, \"is a better thing to find than a five-pound note. He or she is a radiating focus of goodwill\" and a practical demonstration of \"the great Theorem of the Liveableness of Life\". So that if they cannot be happy in the \"handicap race for sixpenny pieces\", let them take their own \"by-road\".</s><s>Early writing and travels.</s><s>Early writing and travels.:Literary and artistic connections. Stevenson was visiting a cousin in England in late 1873 (Stevenson was 23) when he met two people who became very important to him: Sidney Colvin and Fanny (Frances Jane) Sitwell. Sitwell was a 34-year-old woman with a son, who was separated from her husband. She attracted the devotion of many who met her, including Colvin,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### who married her in 1901. Stevenson was also drawn to her, and they kept up a warm correspondence over several years in which he wavered between the role of a suitor and a son (he addressed her as \"Madonna\"). Colvin became Stevenson's literary adviser and was the first editor of his letters after his death. He placed Stevenson's first paid contribution in \"The Portfolio\", an essay titled \"Roads\". Stevenson was soon active in London literary life, becoming acquainted with many of the writers of the time, including Andrew Lang, Edmund Gosse and Leslie Stephen, the editor of \"The Cornhill Magazine\" who took an interest in Stevenson's work. Stephen took Stevenson to visit a patient at the Edinburgh Infirmary named William Ernest Henley, an energetic and talkative poet with a wooden leg. Henley became a close friend and occasional literary collaborator, until a quarrel broke up the friendship in 1888, and he is often considered to be the inspiration for Long John Silver in \"Treasure Island\". Stevenson was sent to Menton on the French Riviera in November 1873 to recuperate after his health failed. He returned in better health in April 1874 and settled down to his studies, but he returned to France several times after that. He####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### made long and frequent trips to the neighbourhood of the Forest of Fontainebleau, staying at Barbizon, Grez-sur-Loing and Nemours and becoming a member of the artists' colonies there. He also travelled to Paris to visit galleries and the theatres. He qualified for the Scottish bar in July 1875, aged 24, and his father added a brass plate to the Heriot Row house reading \"R.L. Stevenson, Advocate\". His law studies did influence his books, but he never practised law; all his energies were spent in travel and writing. One of his journeys was a canoe voyage in Belgium and France with Sir Walter Simpson, a friend from the Speculative Society, a frequent travel companion, and the author of \"The Art of Golf\" (1887). This trip was the basis of his first travel book \"An Inland Voyage\" (1878). Stevenson had a long correspondence with fellow Scot J.M. Barrie. He invited Barrie to visit him in Samoa, but the two never met.</s><s>Early writing and travels.:Marriage. The canoe voyage with Simpson brought Stevenson to Grez-sur-Loing in September 1876, where he met Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### (1840\u20131914), born in Indianapolis. She had married at age 17 and moved to Nevada to rejoin husband Samuel after his participation in the American Civil War. Their children were Isobel (or \"Belle\"), Lloyd and Hervey (who died in 1875). But anger over her husband's infidelities led to a number of separations. In 1875, she had taken her children to France where she and Isobel studied art. By the time Stevenson met her, Fanny was herself a magazine short-story writer of recognised ability. Stevenson returned to Britain shortly after this first meeting, but Fanny apparently remained in his thoughts, and he wrote the essay \"On falling in love\" for \"The Cornhill Magazine\". They met again early in 1877 and became lovers. Stevenson spent much of the following year with her and her children in France. In August 1878, she returned to San Francisco and Stevenson remained in Europe, making the walking trip that formed the basis for \"Travels with a Donkey in the C\u00e9vennes\" (1879). But he set off to join her in August 1879, aged 28, against the advice of his friends and without notifying his parents. He took a second-class passage####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### on the steamship \"Devonia\", in part to save money but also to learn how others travelled and to increase the adventure of the journey. He then travelled overland by train from New York City to California. He later wrote about the experience in \"The Amateur Emigrant\". It was a good experience for his writing, but it broke his health. He was near death when he arrived in Monterey, California, where some local ranchers nursed him back to health. He stayed for a time at the French Hotel located at 530 Houston Street, now a museum dedicated to his memory called the \"Stevenson House\". While there, he often dined \"on the cuff,\" as he said, at a nearby restaurant run by Frenchman Jules Simoneau, which stood at what is now Simoneau Plaza; several years later, he sent Simoneau an inscribed copy of his novel \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" (1886), writing that it would be a stranger case still if Robert Louis Stevenson ever forgot Jules Simoneau. While in Monterey, he wrote an evocative article about \"the Old Pacific Capital\" of Monterey. By December 1879, aged 29, Stevenson had recovered his health enough to continue to San Francisco where####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### he struggled \"all alone on forty-five cents a day, and sometimes less, with quantities of hard work and many heavy thoughts,\" in an effort to support himself through his writing. But by the end of the winter, his health was broken again and he found himself at death's door. Fanny was now divorced and recovered from her own illness, and she came to his bedside and nursed him to recovery. \"After a while,\" he wrote, \"my spirit got up again in a divine frenzy, and has since kicked and spurred my vile body forward with great emphasis and success.\" When his father heard of his 28-year-old son's condition, he cabled him money to help him through this period. Fanny and Robert were married in May 1880. She was 40; he was 29. He said that he was \"a mere complication of cough and bones, much fitter for an emblem of mortality than a bridegroom.\" He travelled with his new wife and her son Lloyd north of San Francisco to Napa Valley and spent a summer honeymoon at an abandoned mining camp on Mount Saint Helena (today designated Robert Louis Stevenson State Park). He wrote about this experience in \"The Silverado Squatters\". He met Charles Warren Stoddard,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### co-editor of the \"Overland Monthly\" and author of \"South Sea Idylls\", who urged Stevenson to travel to the South Pacific, an idea which returned to him many years later. In August 1880, he sailed with Fanny and Lloyd from New York to Britain and found his parents and his friend Sidney Colvin on the wharf at Liverpool, happy to see him return home. Gradually, his wife was able to patch up differences between father and son and make herself a part of the family through her charm and wit.</s><s>Early writing and travels.:England, and back to the United States. The Stevensons shuttled back and forth between Scotland and the Continent, finally settling in 1884 in the Westbourne district of the English seaside town of Bournemouth in Hampshire. They lived in a house Stevenson named 'Skerryvore' after a Scottish lighthouse built by his uncle Alan. From April 1885, 34-year-old Stevenson had the company of the novelist Henry James. They had met previously in London and had recently exchanged views in journal articles on the \u201cart of fiction\u201d and thereafter in a correspondence in which they expressed their admiration for each other\u2019s work. After James had moved to Bourn####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####emouth to help support his invalid sister, Alice, he took up the invitation to pay daily visits to Skerryvore for conversation at the Stevensons' dinner table. Largely bedridden, Stevenson described himself as living \"like a weevil in a biscuit.\" Yet, despite ill health, during his three years in Westbourne, Stevenson wrote the bulk of his most popular work: \"Treasure Island\", \"Kidnapped\", \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" (which established his wider reputation), \"A Child's Garden of Verses\" and \"Underwoods\". Thomas Stevenson died in 1887 leaving his 36-year-old son feeling free to follow the advice of his physician to try a complete change of climate. Stevenson headed for Colorado with his widowed mother and family. But after landing in New York, they decided to spend the winter in the Adirondacks at a cure cottage now known as Stevenson Cottage at Saranac Lake, New York. During the intensely cold winter, Stevenson wrote some of his best essays, including \"Pulvis et Umbra\". He also began \"The Master of Ballantrae\" and lightheartedly planned a cruise to the southern Pacific Ocean for the following summer.</s><s>Ref####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####lections on the art of writing. Stevenson's critical essays on literature contain \"few sustained analyses of style or content\". In \"A Penny Plain and Two-pence Coloured\" (1884) he suggests that his own approach owed much to the exaggerated and romantic world that, as a child, he had entered as proud owner of Skelt's Juvenile Drama\u2014a toy set of cardboard characters who were actors in melodramatic dramas. \"A Gossip on Romance\" (1882) and \"A Gossip on a Novel of Dumas's\" (1887) imply that it is better to entertain than to instruct. Stevenson very much saw himself in the mould of Sir Walter Scott, a storyteller with an ability to transport his readers away from themselves and their circumstances. He took issue with what he saw as the tendency in French realism to dwell on sordidness and ugliness. In \"The Lantern-Bearer\" (1888) he appears to take Emile Zola to task for failing to seek out nobility in his protagonists. In \"A Humble Remonstrance\", Stevenson answers Henry James's claim in \"The Art of Fiction\" (1884) that the novel competes with life. Stevenson protests that no####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### novel can ever hope to match life's complexity; it merely abstracts from life to produce a harmonious pattern of its own.Man's one method, whether he reasons or creates, is to half-shut his eyes against the dazzle and confusion of reality...Life is monstrous, infinite, illogical, abrupt and poignant; a work of art, in comparison, is neat, finite, self-contained, rational, flowing, and emasculate...The novel, which is a work of art, exists, not by its resemblances to life, which are forced and material... but by its immeasurable difference from life, which is designed and significant. It is not clear, however, that in this there was any real basis for disagreement with James. Stevenson had presented James with a copy of \"Kidnapped\", but it was \"Treasure Island\" that James favoured. Written as a story for boys, Stevenson had thought it in \u201cno need of psychology or fine writing\", but its success is credited with liberating children's writing from the \"chains of Victorian didacticism\".</s><s>Politics: \"The Day After Tomorrow\". During his college years, Stevenson briefly identified himself as a \"red-hot socialist\". But already by age 26####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### he was writing of looking back on this time \"with something like regret.... Now I know that in thus turning Conservative with years, I am going through the normal cycle of change and travelling in the common orbit of men's opinions.\" His cousin and biographer Sir Graham Balfour claimed that Stevenson \"probably throughout life would, if compelled to vote, have always supported the Conservative candidate.\" In 1866, then 15-year-old Stevenson did vote for Benjamin Disraeli, the Tory democrat and future Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, for the Lord Rectorship of the University of Edinburgh. But this was against a markedly illiberal challenger, the historian Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle was notorious for his anti-democratic and pro-slavery views. In \"The Day After Tomorrow\", appearing in \"The Contemporary Review\" (April 1887), Stevenson suggested: \"we are all becoming Socialists without knowing it\". Legislation \"grows authoritative, grows philanthropical, bristles with new duties and new penalties, and casts a spawn of inspectors, who now begin, note-book in hand, to darken the face of England\". He is referring to the steady growth in social legislation in Britain since the first of the Conservative-sponsored Factory Acts (which,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in 1833, established a professional Factory Inspectorate). Stevenson cautioned that this \"new waggon-load of laws\" points to a future in which our grandchildren might \"taste the pleasures of existence in something far liker an ant-heap that any previous human polity\". Yet in reproducing the essay his latter-day libertarian admirers omit his express understanding for the abandonment of Whiggish, classical-liberal notions of laissez faire. \"Liberty\", Stevenson wrote, \"has served us a long while\" but like all other virtues \"she has taken wages\". [Liberty] has dutifully served Mammon; so that many things we were accustomed to admire as the benefits of freedom and common to all, were truly benefits of wealth, and took their value from our neighbour's poverty...Freedom to be desirable, involves kindness, wisdom, and all the virtues of the free; but the free man as we have seen him in action has been, as of yore, only the master of many helots; and the slaves are still ill-fed, ill-clad, ill-taught, ill-housed, insolently entreated, and driven to their mines and workshops by the lash of famine. In January 1888,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### aged 37, in response to American press coverage of the Land War in Ireland, Stevenson penned a political essay (rejected by \"Scribner's\" magazine and never published in his lifetime) that advanced a broadly conservative theme: the necessity of \"staying internal violence by rigid law\". Notwithstanding his title, \"Confessions of a Unionist\", Stevenson defends neither the union with Britain (she had \"majestically demonstrated her incapacity to rule Ireland\") nor \"landlordism\" (scarcely more defensible in Ireland than, as he had witnessed it, in the goldfields of California). Rather he protests the readiness to pass \"lightly\" over crimes\u2014\"unmanly murders and the harshest extremes of boycotting\"\u2014where these are deemed \"political\". This he argues is to \"defeat law\" (which is ever a \"compromise\") and to invite \"anarchy\": it is \"the sentimentalist preparing the pathway for the brute\".</s><s>Final years in the Pacific.</s><s>Final years in the Pacific.:Pacific voyages. In June 1888, Stevenson chartered the yacht \"Casco\" and set sail with his family from San Francisco. The vessel \"plowed her path of snow across the empty deep, far from all####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### track of commerce, far from any hand of help.\" The sea air and thrill of adventure for a time restored his health, and for nearly three years he wandered the eastern and central Pacific, stopping for extended stays at the Hawaiian Islands, where he became a good friend of King Kal\u0101kaua. He befriended the king's niece Princess Victoria Kaiulani, who also had Scottish heritage. He spent time at the Gilbert Islands, Tahiti, New Zealand and the Samoan Islands. During this period, he completed \"The Master of Ballantrae\", composed two ballads based on the legends of the islanders, and wrote \"The Bottle Imp\". He preserved the experience of these years in his various letters and in his \"In the South Seas\" (which was published posthumously). He made a voyage in 1889 with Lloyd on the trading schooner \"Equator\", visiting Butaritari, Mariki, Apaiang and Abemama in the Gilbert Islands. They spent several months on Abemama with tyrant-chief Tem Binoka, whom Stevenson described in \"In the South Seas\". Stevenson left Sydney, Australia, on the \"Janet Nicoll\" in April 1890 for his third and final voyage among the South Seas islands.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### He intended to produce another book of travel writing to follow his earlier book \"In the South Seas\", but it was his wife who eventually published her journal of their third voyage. (Fanny misnames the ship in her account \"The Cruise of the Janet Nichol\".) A fellow passenger was Jack Buckland, whose stories of life as an island trader became the inspiration for the character of Tommy Hadden in \"The Wrecker\" (1892), which Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne wrote together. Buckland visited the Stevensons at Vailima in 1894.</s><s>Final years in the Pacific.:Political engagement in Samoa. In December 1889, 39-year-old Stevenson and his extended family arrived at the port of Apia in the Samoan islands and there he and Fanny decided to settle. In January 1890 they purchased at Vailima, some miles inland from Apia the capital, on which they built the islands\u2019 first two-storey house. Fanny's sister, Nellie Van de Grift Sanchez, wrote that \u201cit was in Samoa that the word \u2018home\u2019 first began to have a real meaning for these gypsy wanderers\u201d. In May 1891, they were joined by Stevenson's mother####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, Margaret. While his wife set about managing and working the estate, 40-year-old Stevenson took the native name Tusitala (Samoan for \"Teller of Tales\"), and began collecting local stories. Often he would exchange these for his own tales. The first work of literature in Samoan was his translation of \"The Bottle Imp\", which presents a Pacific-wide community as the setting for a moral fable. Immersing himself in the islands' culture, occasioned a \"political awakening\": it placed Stevenson \"at an angle\" to the rival great powers, Britain, Germany and the United States whose warships were common sights in Samoan harbours. He understood that, as in the Scottish Highlands (comparisons with his homeland \"came readily\"), an indigenous clan society was unprepared for the arrival of foreigners who played upon its existing rivalries and divisions. As the external pressures upon Samoan society grew, tensions soon descended into several inter-clan wars. No longer content to be a \"romancer\", Stevenson became a reporter and an agitator, firing off letters to \"The Times\" which \"rehearsed with an ironic twist that surely owed something to his Edinburgh legal training\", a tale of European and American misconduct. His concern for####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Polynesians is also found in the \"South Sea Letters\", published in magazines in 1891 (and then in book form as \"In the South Seas\" in 1896). In an effort he feared might result in his own deportation, Stevenson helped secure the recall of two European officials. \"\" (1892) was a detailed chronicle of the intersection of rivalries between the great powers and the first Samoan Civil War. As much as he said he disdained politics\u2014\"I used to think meanly of the plumber\", he wrote to his friend Sidney Colvin, \"but how he shines beside the politician!\"\u2014Stevenson felt himself obliged to take sides. He openly allied himself with chief Mataafa, whose rival Malietoa was backed by the Germans whose firms were beginning to monopolise copra and cocoa bean processing. Stevenson was alarmed above all by what he perceived as the Samoans' economic innocence\u2014their failure to secure their claim to proprietorship of the land (in a Lockean sense) through improving management and labour. In 1894 just months before his death, he addressed the island chiefs:There is but one way to defend Samoa. Hear it before it is too late. It is to make roads, and gardens, and care for####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### your trees, and sell their produce wisely, and, in one word, to occupy and use your country... if you do not occupy and use your country, others will. It will not continue to be yours or your children's, if you occupy it for nothing. You and your children will, in that case, be cast out into outer darkness\". He had \"seen these judgments of God\", not only in Hawaii where abandoned native churches stood like tombstones \"over a grave, in the midst of the white men\u2019s sugar fields\", but also in Ireland and \"in the mountains of my own country Scotland\".These were a fine people in the past brave, gay, faithful, and very much like Samoans, except in one particular, that they were much wiser and better at that business of fighting of which you think so much. But the time came to them as it now comes to you, and it did not find them ready... Five years after Stevenson's death, the Samoan Islands were partitioned between Germany and the United States.</s><s>Last works. Stevenson wrote an estimated 700,000 words during his years on Samoa. He completed \"The Beach of Fales\u00e1\", the first-person tale of a Scottish copra trader on a South####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Sea island. Wiltshire is heroic in terms neither of his actions nor a preoccupation with his own soul. Rather he is a man of limited understanding and imagination, comfortable with his own prejudices: where, he wonders, can he find \"whites\" for his \"half caste\" daughters. The villains are white, their behaviour towards the islanders ruthlessly duplicitous. Stevenson saw \"The Beach of Fales\u00e1\" as the ground-breaking work in his turn away from romance to realism. Stevenson wrote to his friend Sidney Colvin: \"The Ebb-Tide\" (1894), the misadventures of three deadbeats marooned in the Tahitian port of Papeete, has been described as presenting \"a microcosm of imperialist society, directed by greedy but incompetent whites, the labour supplied by long-suffering natives who fulfil their duties without orders and are true to the missionary faith which the Europeans make no pretence of respecting\". It confirmed the new Realistic turn in Stevenson's writing away from romance and adolescent adventure. The first sentence reads: \"Throughout the island world of the Pacific, scattered men of many European races and from almost every grade of society carry activity and disseminate disease\". No longer was Stevenson####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### writing about human nature \"in terms of a contest between Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\": \"the edges of moral responsibility and the margins of moral judgement were too blurred\". As with \"The Beach of Fales\u00e0\", in \"The Ebb Tide\" contemporary reviewers find parallels with several of Conrad's works: \"Almayer\u2019s Folly\", \"An Outcast of the Islands\", \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\u2019\", \"Heart of Darkness\", \"Lord Jim\". With his imagination still residing in Scotland and returning to earlier form, Stevenson also wrote \"Catriona\" (1893), a sequel to his earlier novel \"Kidnapped\" (1886), continuing the adventures of its hero David Balfour. Although he felt, as a writer, that \"there was never any man had so many irons in the fire\". by the end of 1893 Stevenson feared that he had \"overworked\" and exhausted his creative vein. His writing was partly driven by the need to meet the expenses of Vailima. But in a last burst of energy he began work on \"Weir of Hermiston\". \"It's so good that it frightens me,\" he is reported to have exclaimed. He felt that####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### this was the best work he had done. Set in eighteenth century Scotland, it is a story of a society that (however different), like Samoa is witnessing a breakdown of social rules and structures leading to growing moral ambivalence.</s><s>Death. On 3 December 1894, Stevenson was talking to his wife and straining to open a bottle of wine when he suddenly exclaimed, \"What's that?\", then asked his wife, \"Does my face look strange?\", and collapsed. (Some sources have stated that he was, instead, attempting to make mayonaisse when he collapsed.) He died within a few hours, at the age of 44, due to a stroke. The Samoans insisted on surrounding his body with a watch-guard during the night and on bearing him on their shoulders to nearby Mount Vaea, where they buried him on a spot overlooking the sea on land donated by British Acting Vice Consul Thomas Trood. Based on Stevenson's poem \"Requiem\", the following epitaph is inscribed on his tomb: Stevenson was loved by Samoans, and his tombstone epigraph was translated to a Samoan song of grief. The requiem appears on the eastern side of the grave. On the western side the biblical passage of Ruth 1:16####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-17 is inscribed:</s><s>Artistic reception. Half of Stevenson's original manuscripts are lost, including those of \"Treasure Island\", \"The Black Arrow\" and \"The Master of Ballantrae\". His heirs sold his papers during World War I, and many Stevenson documents were auctioned off in 1918. Stevenson was a celebrity in his own time, being admired by many other writers, including Marcel Proust, Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry James, J. M. Barrie, Rudyard Kipling, Emilio Salgari, and later Cesare Pavese, Bertolt Brecht, Ernest Hemingway, Jack London, Vladimir Nabokov, and G. K. Chesterton, who said that Stevenson \"seemed to pick the right word up on the point of his pen, like a man playing spillikins.\" Stevenson was seen for much of the 20th century as a second-class writer. He became relegated to children's literature and horror genres, condemned by literary figures such as Virginia Woolf (daughter of his early mentor Leslie Stephen) and her husband Leonard Woolf, and he was gradually excluded from the canon of literature taught in schools. His exclusion reached its nadir in the 1973 2,000-page \"Ox####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ford Anthology of English Literature\" where he was entirely unmentioned, and \"The Norton Anthology of English Literature\" excluded him from 1968 to 2000 (1st\u20137th editions), including him only in the eighth edition (2006). The late 20th century brought a re-evaluation of Stevenson as an artist of great range and insight, a literary theorist, an essayist and social critic, a witness to the colonial history of the Pacific Islands and a humanist. He was praised by Roger Lancelyn Green, one of the Oxford Inklings, as a writer of a consistently high level of \"literary skill or sheer imaginative power\" and a pioneer of the Age of the Story Tellers along with H. Rider Haggard. He is now evaluated as a peer of authors such as Joseph Conrad (whom Stevenson influenced with his South Seas fiction) and Henry James, with new scholarly studies and organisations devoted to him. Throughout the vicissitudes of his scholarly reception, Stevenson has remained popular worldwide. According to the Index Translationum, Stevenson is ranked the 26th-most-translated author in the world, ahead of Oscar Wilde and Edgar Allan Poe. On the subject of Stevenson's modern reputation, American film critic Roger Ebert wrote in 1996,</s>####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####<s>Monuments and commemoration.</s><s>Monuments and commemoration.:United Kingdom. The Writers' Museum near Edinburgh's Royal Mile devotes a room to Stevenson, containing some of his personal possessions from childhood through to adulthood. A bronze relief memorial to Stevenson, designed by the American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1904, is mounted in the Moray Aisle of St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh. Saint-Gaudens' scaled-down version of this relief is in the collection of the Montclair Art Museum. Another small version depicting Stevenson with a cigarette in his hand rather than the pen he holds in the St. Giles memorial is displayed in the Nichols House Museum in Beacon Hill, Boston. In the West Princes Street Gardens below Edinburgh Castle a simple upright stone is inscribed: \"RLS \u2013 A Man of Letters 1850\u20131894\" by sculptor Ian Hamilton Finlay in 1987. In 2013, a statue of Stevenson as a child with his dog was unveiled by the author Ian Rankin outside Colinton Parish Church. The sculptor of the statue was Alan Herriot, and the money to erect it was raised by the Colinton Community Conservation Trust. Stevenson's house Skerryvore, at the head of Alum Chine, was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### severely damaged by bombs during a destructive and lethal raid in the Bournemouth Blitz. Despite a campaign to save it, the building was demolished. A garden was designed by the Bournemouth Corporation in 1957 as a memorial to Stevenson, on the site of his Westbourne house, \"Skerryvore\", which he occupied from 1885 to 1887. A statue of the Skerryvore lighthouse is present on the site. Robert Louis Stevenson Avenue in Westbourne is named after him. In 1994, to mark the 100th anniversary of Stevenson's death, the Royal Bank of Scotland issued a series of commemorative \u00a31 notes which featured a quill pen and Stevenson's signature on the obverse, and Stevenson's face on the reverse side. Alongside Stevenson's portrait are scenes from some of his books and his house in Western Samoa. Two million notes were issued, each with a serial number beginning \"RLS\". The first note to be printed was sent to Samoa in time for their centenary celebrations on 3 December 1994.</s><s>Monuments and commemoration.:United States. The Stevenson House at 530 Houston Street in Monterey, California, formerly the French Hotel, memorialises Stevenson's 1879 stay in \"the Old Pacific Capital\", as he was crossing####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the United States to join his future wife, Fanny Osbourne. The Stevenson House museum is graced with a bas-relief depicting the sickly author writing in bed. Spyglass Hill Golf Course, originally called Pebble Beach Pines Golf Club, was renamed \"Spyglass Hill\" by Samuel F. B. Morse (1885\u20131969), the founder of Pebble Beach Company, after a place in Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\". All the holes at Spyglass Hill are named after characters and places in the novel. The Robert Louis Stevenson Museum in St. Helena, California, is home to over 11,000 objects and artifacts, the majority of which belonged to Stevenson. Opened in 1969, the museum houses such treasures as his childhood rocking chair, writing desk, toy soldiers and personal writings among many other items. The museum is free to the public and serves as an academic archive for students, writers and Stevenson enthusiasts. In San Francisco there is an outdoor Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial in Portsmouth Square. At least six US public and private schools are named after Stevenson, in the Upper West Side of New York City, in Fridley, Minnesota, in Burbank, California, in Grandview Heights, Ohio (suburb of Columbus), in San Francisco, California####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, and in Merritt Island, Florida. There is an R. L. Stevenson middle school in Honolulu, Hawaii and in Saint Helena, California. Stevenson School in Pebble Beach, California, was established in 1952 and still exists as a college preparatory boarding school. Robert Louis Stevenson State Park near Calistoga, California, contains the location where he and Fanny spent their honeymoon in 1880.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, and by some, one of the greatest dribblers ever. Garrincha played a vital role in Brazil's 1958 and 1962 World Cup victories. In 1962, when Pel\u00e9 got injured, Garrincha led Brazil to a World Cup victory with a dominating performance throughout the tournament. He also became the first player to win the Golden Ball (Player of the tournament), Golden Boot (Leading Goalscorer) and the World Cup in the same tournament. He was also named in the World Cup All-Star Teams of both 1958 World Cup and 1962 World Cup. In 1994, he was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team. Brazil never lost a match while fielding both Garrincha and Pel\u00e9. In 1999, he came seventh in the FIFA Player of the Century grand jury vote. He is a member of the World Team of the 20th Century, and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Hall of Fame. Due to his immense popularity####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in Brazil, he was also called \"Alegria do Povo\" (People's Joy) and \"Anjo de Pernas Tortas\" (Bent-Legged Angel). At the club level, Garrincha played the majority of his professional career for the Brazilian team Botafogo. In the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, the home team room is known as \"Garrincha\". In the capital Bras\u00edlia, the Est\u00e1dio Nacional Man\u00e9 Garrincha is named after him. He is credited for inspiring the first bullfighting chants of ol\u00e9 to be used at football grounds.</s><s>Early life. Garrincha was born in Pau Grande, a district of Mag\u00e9, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 1933. He was born with his right leg 6 centimetres shorter than his left, also his left leg turned outwards and his right turned inwards, leading one doctor to certify him as crippled as a child. His father was an alcoholic, drinking cacha\u00e7a heavily, a problem which Garrincha would inherit. A boy with a carefree attitude, he was smaller than other kids his age, with his sister Rosa noticing he was as small as a little bird she started calling him Garr####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####incha, the north-eastern name for the wren, a little brown bird. The name stuck and by the age of four years he was known as Garrincha to his family and friends. Garrincha was also known as Man\u00e9 (short for \"Manuel\") by his friends. The combined \"Man\u00e9 Garrincha\" is common among fans in Brazil. Garrincha was known amongst footballing scouts but did not arrive in professional football until his late teens; he had no interest in a professional career despite his immense talent. Garrincha's younger brother, Jimmy dos Santos, played 20 games for S\u00e9rie A side CR Vasco da Gama in 1959.</s><s>Club career. Garrincha was already married and a parent when he signed for Botafogo in 1953. Team officials were ecstatic to learn that he was over 18 and able to be treated as a professional. In his first training session, he demonstrated his extraordinary skills by dribbling the ball through the legs of N\u00edlton Santos, a Brazilian international defender and defensive midfielder who had 16 international caps. Santos was so impressed with the young Garrincha, he asked that Botafogo sign him. He played in a 5\u20130 win for Botafogo####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####'s reserves and then scored a hat trick on his first-team d\u00e9but against Bonsucesso on 19 July 1953. Garrincha continued to play brilliantly, but Brazil had other talented players in his position, notably Julinho and together with a new European style of play centered on teamwork, he was not named in the squad for the 1954 World Cup. He helped Botafogo win the Campeonato Carioca in 1957 by scoring 20 goals in 26 games finishing second in the league scoring charts and this convinced the national team selectors to name him to the 1958 World Cup squad. After the 1962 World Cup, Garrincha returned to Rio and carried Botafogo to victory in the 1962 \"Campeonato Carioca\" final against Flamengo. Garrincha played for Botafogo for 12 years, the bulk of his professional career. He won the \"Campeonato Carioca\" three times with them, scored 232 goals in 581 matches, and became a symbol of the history of the club. In 1966, with his career declining, he was sold to Corinthians. Two years later, he signed for Colombian team Atl\u00e9tico Junior. The same year he went back to Brazil and joined Flamengo, where####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### he would stay until 1969. In 1971, there were rumours that Garrincha, 38, would join French club Red Star, but he never signed and stayed in Brazil. An entertainer renowned for his dribbling skills in taking on opposing players, Garrincha inspiring the first bullfighting chants of ol\u00e9 to be used at football grounds; during a 1958 club game for Botafogo he gave a footballing lesson to River Plate defender Vairo, constantly teasing, feinting and going past him to ole's from the crowd, and when he \"forgot\" the ball and sprinted away with Vairo running after him the chants of ol\u00e9s changed to laughter. Garrincha's professional career as a footballer lasted until 1972, when he played for Olaria, but he played occasional exhibition matches until 1982. Garrincha was subject to numerous transfer attempts by rich European clubs like Juventus of Turin, Italy who tried to sign him in 1954. Real Madrid of Spain tried to sign him in 1959 after some stunning performances by him on a tour of Europe. Internazionale, AC Milan and Juventus of Italy considered jointly signing him in 1963 (he would have to spend a season with each); a deal that would have been unique in football.</s><s>####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####International career. Garrincha played 50 international matches for Brazil between 1955 and 1966, and was a starter for the national team in the 1958, 1962 and 1966 World Cups. Brazil lost only one match with him on the pitch, against Hungary at the 1966 World Cup. This was the last time Garrincha played in National team. Pel\u00e9 did not play the game against Hungary, and thus Brazil never lost when Garrincha and Pel\u00e9 were in the same lineup. His first cap was against Chile in Rio de Janeiro in 1955. He played two matches at the Copa Am\u00e9rica of 1957 and four in the 1959 edition, Brazil finished runners up in both editions.</s><s>International career.:1958 World Cup. On 29 May, ten days before the 1958 World Cup finals started, Garrincha scored one of his most famous goals, against Fiorentina in Italy. He beat four defenders and the goalkeeper, before stopping on the goal line. Rather than kicking the ball into the open goal, he then dribbled past the returning Enzo Robotti to score. Despite his stunning performance his coaches were upset at what they considered an irresponsible move and this likely led to Garrincha not being picked for Brazil's first two matches of the 1958 tournament. However####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, he did start their third match against the USSR; this match marked the debut of both Garrincha and Pel\u00e9 (although Garrincha was seven years older than Pele, both being born in October, respectively in 1933 and in 1940). The Soviets were one of the favourites for the tournament, and the Brazilians had been nervous about playing them. Their manager, Vicente Feola, decided to attack directly from the kickoff. Garrincha received the ball on the right wing, beat three opposing players and took a shot which hit the post. With the match still less than a minute old, he set up a chance for Pel\u00e9, who hit the crossbar, and continually caused problems for the Soviet defence. Brazil were so impressive in the opening moments that the game's start is often referred to as \"the best three minutes of football of all time\". Brazil won the match 2\u20130. Following the Brazilians' narrow 1\u20130 quarter-final win against Wales on 19 June 1958, Mel Hopkins (the fullback who faced him that game) described Garrincha as \"a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too.\" In the final against Sweden, Brazil fell behind 0\u20131 early, but rapidly equalized after Garrincha went past his marker on the right wing and sent a cross for Vav\u00e1 to score. Before the end of the first half, Garrincha made a similar play, again setting up Vav\u00e1 to make the score 2\u20131. Brazil ended winning the match and its first World Cup trophy, with Garrincha being one of the best players of the tournament; he was voted to the \"Best XI\" for the competition. Garrincha never bothered about the 'details' of the game. As his teammates were celebrating the World Cup win, he was initially bemused, having been under the impression that the competition was more league-like and that Brazil would play all the other teams twice.</s><s>International career.:1958\u20131962. Garrincha put on weight after the World Cup, partly because of his drinking, so he was dropped from the national team for a friendly match in Rio against England on 13 May 1959. Later that month, he went on tour with Botafogo in Sweden and got a local girl pregnant. When####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### he returned to Brazil, he drove home to Pau Grande and ran over his father, Amaro. He drove off without stopping, with an angry mob chasing him, and when they caught up with him they found him \"drunk, almost catatonic, and with no grasp of what he had done.\" In August, his wife, Nair, gave birth to their fifth child, and his mistress Iraci announced her first pregnancy. His father died of liver cancer on 10 October having been dependent on alcohol for years.</s><s>International career.:1962 World Cup. Garrincha was the most outstanding player of the 1962 FIFA World Cup. When Pel\u00e9 suffered an injury after the second match and was sidelined for the rest of the tournament, Garrincha played a leading role in Brazil's triumph, excelling particularly against England and Chile, scoring 4 goals in those two matches. After one win and one draw, Brazil faced Spain, without Pel\u00e9. The South Americans were losing 0\u20131 in the second half. Amarildo, Pel\u00e9's substitute for the remainder of the tournament, scored the equalizer. Five minutes before the end, Garrincha took the ball on the right flank, dribbled past a defender and paused. Then he dribbled past the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### same man and another defender, and sent a cross to Amarildo, who scored again to win the match. In the quarter-finals against England, Garrincha opened the score with a header off a corner kick. England equalized before half time. In the second half, Vav\u00e1 scored Brazil's second goal off a rebound of a shot by Garrincha; minutes later, Garrincha received a ball outside the penalty area, paused, and sent a curved shot \u2013 known as the \"banana shot\" \u2013 into the bottom of the net. Brazil won 3\u20131 and advanced to the semi-finals. The British football press said he \"was Stanley Matthews, Tom Finney and a snake charmer all rolled into one.\" During the quarter final, a stray dog ran onto the pitch and evaded all of the players' efforts to catch it until England striker Jimmy Greaves got down on all fours to beckon the animal. Though successful in catching the dog, it managed to urinate all over Greaves' England shirt. Greaves claimed that Garrincha thought the incident was so amusing that he took the dog home as a pet. Ruy Castro's book expands upon this, by clarifying that the dog was captured by an official,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and raffled off to the Brazilian squad, a raffle which Garrincha won. The dog was named \"Bi\" (from \"bi-campe\u00f5es\" - \"two times champions\"). He scored two more goals in the semi-final against the hosts, Chile, as Brazil went on to win 4\u20132. His first goal was a 20-yard left-foot shot; the second one, a header. A subsequent headline in the Chilean newspaper \"El Mercurio\" read: \"What planet is Garrincha from?\" Garrincha was sent off in that match after 83 minutes for retaliating after being continually fouled. However, he was not suspended for the following match. Brazil faced Czechoslovakia in the final. Garrincha played despite suffering from a severe fever, which did not prevent Brazil from winning 3\u20131 and him from getting voted player of the tournament. It was the second consecutive World Cup won by Garrincha and Brazil.</s><s>International career.:1966 World Cup. Though well short of match fitness and still struggling with a knee injury, which would plague him for the rest of his career, Garrincha still played in the first match of the tournament, a 2\u20130 win against Bulgaria, Garr####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####incha scored one of the goals of this game with a free kick taken with the outside of his foot (the second goal of this game was scored by Pel\u00e9 - this was the only time when Garrincha and Pel\u00e9 both scored goals in the same game). Then Brazil lost 1\u20133 to Hungary at Goodison Park, in Garrincha's last ever international match, which was the only time Garrincha lost a match with the Brazil national team; he did not play in the last match of the first round against Portugal. Brazil were eliminated in the first round.</s><s>International career.:Retirement from professional football and farewell. In 1973, although he was still signed by Olaria, Garrincha decided to leave professional football. Apart from his age (he was almost 40), \"there was another reason for wanting to retire: he had become a grandfather for the first time \u2013 his daughter Edenir had just given birth to Alexandra \u2013 and being a professional football player and a grandfather felt weird.\" Alexandra with her three children still live in Garrincha's house in Pau Grande. On 19 December 1973, a farewell match for Garrincha between a FIFA World team and Brazil was celebrated at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, in front of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 131,000 spectators. The FIFA team was composed mainly of Argentine and Uruguayan players, while Brazil fielded Pel\u00e9, Carlos Alberto, and several other members of the 1970 World Cup winning squad. Garrincha started the match, and while in the first half, at a point when Brazil had the ball in attack, the referee stopped the match so Garrincha could leave the pitch and receive the crowd's respects. Garrincha then did a lap around the pitch before disappearing through the stadium's tunnel.</s><s>Final years and death. The success Garrincha enjoyed on the football pitch was in stark contrast to his personal life. He drank heavily throughout his adult life and was involved in several serious road accidents, notably a crash into a lorry in April 1969 which killed his mother-in-law. He was married twice, first to Nair Marques in 1952 (they separated in 1965), a factory worker from Pau Grande with whom he had eight daughters, and second to Elza Soares, a samba singer whom he married in an unofficial ceremony in March 1966. Soares had also been married previously, and the marriage saw Garrincha cast as a villain by the same press that had once feted him. The couple separated in 1977, when####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Soares left him after he struck her during an argument. Garrincha had other significant affairs, including one with showgirl Angelita Martinez, and he is known to have fathered at least 14 children. After a series of financial and marital problems, Garrincha died of cirrhosis of the liver on 20 January 1983, in an alcoholic coma in Rio de Janeiro. He had been hospitalized eight times in the previous year, and by the time of his death he was a physical and mental wreck. His last years were unhappy and obscure \u2013 he seemed to have become a forgotten hero \u2013 but his funeral procession, from the Maracan\u00e3 to Pau Grande, drew millions of fans, friends and former players to pay their respects. His epitaph reads \"\"Here rests in peace the one who was the Joy of the People \u2013 Man\u00e9 Garrincha.\"\" People had painted on the wall: \"Obrigado, Garrincha, por voc\u00ea ter vivido\" (Thank you, Garrincha, for having lived). A multi-use stadium in Brasilia, the Est\u00e1dio Nacional Man\u00e9 Garrincha, is named after him. His career was presented in the 1962 film \"\", and in 2003, another movie, called \"G####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####arrincha \u2013 Estrela Solit\u00e1ria\" (\"Lonely Star\"), based on Ruy Castro's book, depicted his life on and off the field.</s><s>Style of play. An explosive, agile, and diminutive right winger with a low centre of gravity, Garrincha is renowned for his creativity, pace, and speed of execution, as well as his remarkable ball control, technique, flair, imagination, dribbling skills and feints on the wing, which enabled him to create chances out of nothing. Capable of both scoring goals and creating chances for teammates, he also possessed a powerful shot with either foot and was a gifted crosser and set piece specialist known for his bending free kicks and corners taken with the outside of his foot. However, it was his dribbling skills he was most famous for, a skill he retained throughout his career. Regarding Garrincha's dribbling ability, football writer Scott Murray remarked when writing for \"The Guardian\" in 2010: \"...the bottom line is uncontestable: Garrincha was the greatest dribbler ever.\" Adored by the Brazilian public due to his innocence, carefree attitude and ability to entertain in making fools of opposing players, Garrincha was referred to as \"Joy of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### People\". Djalma Santos, his Brazil teammate, stated, \"He had a childish spirit. Garrincha was football's answer to Charlie Chaplin.\" Examples of his shooting ability are his goals in World Cups against England in 1962 and Bulgaria in 1966. He was also able to turn on himself at top speed and explode at unusual angles, which he used to great effect. The numerous attacks and goal opportunities he generated through individual plays would often end up in an accurate pass to a teammate in a position to score. This occurred in the first two of Brazil's goals in the 1958 World Cup final and the second goal against Spain in the 1962 tournament. He was also an excellent header of the ball despite his relatively short stature. He is one of a few players to have scored direct from a corner, a feat he managed to do 4 times in his career. Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he was voted into the World Team of the 20th Century by 250 of the world's most respected football writers and journalists, came seventh in the FIFA Player of the Century grand jury vote, and was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team.</s><s>Honours.

Despite his physical disability, Garrincha became one of the greatest footballers of all time, known for his incredible dribbling skills and ability to score goals.\n\nGarrincha started his professional football career in 1953 with Botafogo, a club based in Rio de Janeiro. He quickly became a star player, helping Botafogo win two Rio de Janeiro championships and one Brazilian championship. He also played for the Brazilian national team, where he formed a lethal partnership with fellow forward Pele.\n\nGarrincha was known for his unique style of play, which often involved dribbling past defenders with ease. He won two World Cups with Brazil, in 1958 and 1962, and was named the best player of the latter tournament. He also won two South American Championships with Brazil in 1959 and 1962.\n\nOff the field, Garrincha had a troubled personal life. He struggled with alcoholism and was often unfaithful to his wives. He died on January 20, 1983, from cirrhosis of the liver, at the age of 49.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Gabriela Sabatini Gabriela Beatriz Sabatini (; born 16 May 1970) is an Argentine-Italian former professional tennis player. A former world No. 3 in both singles and doubles, Sabatini was one of the leading players from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, amassing 41 titles. In singles, Sabatini won the 1990 US Open, the Tour Finals in 1988 and 1994, and was runner-up at Wimbledon 1991, the 1988 US Open, and the silver medalist at the 1988 Olympics. In doubles, Sabatini won Wimbledon in 1988 partnering Steffi Graf, and reached three French Open finals. Among Open era players who did not reach the world No. 1 ranking, Sabatini has the most wins over reigning world No. 1 ranked players. In 2006, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and in 2018 \"Tennis\" Magazine ranked her as the 20th-greatest female player of the preceding 50 years.</s><s>Childhood and junior career. Sabatini was born 16 May 1970 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Osvaldo and Beatriz Garofalo Sabatini. Her father was an executive in General Motors.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Her elder brother, Osvaldo, is an actor and producer. Sabatini started playing tennis at the age of six, and won her first tournament at eight. In 1983, age 13, she became the youngest player ever to win the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. She won the girls' singles at the 1984 French Open and the US Open girls' doubles with fellow Argentinian Mercedes Paz. Sabatini reached world No. 1 in the junior rankings that year and was named 1984 Junior World Champion by the International Tennis Federation. Sabatini stated that she deliberately lost matches in her youth to avoid having to do on-court interviews and therefore avoid media attention. She said that her shyness had been a major problem, and she thought she had to speak on-court after playing in the final of a tournament; so, she would lose in the semifinals.</s><s>Career.</s><s>Career.:Early years. In 1985, aged 15 years and three weeks, Sabatini became one of the youngest-ever players to reach the semifinals of the French Open, where she lost to Chris Evert. She won her first WTA Tour singles title later that year in Tokyo. She first entered the world's top ten (at #10) in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### September 1985, and ended the year ranked number 12. She received the WTA Newcomer of the Year award. Sabatini reached the semifinals of Wimbledon in 1986, losing to Martina Navratilova, before winning her second WTA title in Buenos Aires, She re-entered the world's top ten in September 1986 and would remain there for 508 consecutive weeks until May 1996. Sabatini reached the semifinals of the 1987 French Open, and reached the final of the 1987 WTA Tour Championships, losing to Steffi Graf both times. She also won three WTA titles, including defeating world No. 4, Pam Shriver in Brighton.</s><s>Career.:1988: US Open and Olympics finals; WTA Finals champion. In February 1988, Sabatini entered the top five in rankings, and would remain there uninterrupted until August 1993. Having reached her third French Open semifinal, she then reached her first Grand Slam singles final at the US Open, where she lost to Graf in three sets. Sabatini represented Argentina in the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul and was selected to carry her country's flag in the opening ceremony. She went on to win the silver medal in the women's singles competition, losing to Gra####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####f in the final. Sabatini teamed-up with Graf to win the women's doubles title at Wimbledon that year. At the end of 1988, Sabatini won her first WTA Tour Championships, without dropping a set.</s><s>Career.:1989. In 1989, Sabatini reached seven tournament finals and won four titles, including the Miami Open (defeating Evert in the final). In defeating world No. 2, Martina Navratilova, and No. 1, Steffi Graf, to obtain the Amelia Island title, she became only the fifth player in Open Era history to defeat both the No. 1 and 2 ranked players at the same tournament. She also reached the semifinals of the Australian Open and US Open Grand Slam tournaments.</s><s>Career.:1990: US Open champion. At the Australian Open, Sabatini sprained her ankle during a third-round match while one set up, and had to be taken off Centre Court in a wheelchair. 80 minutes later, in the following match, Mark Woodforde also sprained his ankle on the same court and was forced to retire by wheelchair too. Multiple players had complained of the dangers of playing on the Rebound Ace hard court surface used at the tournament####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, which they claimed became very sticky \u2013 and therefore potentially dangerous \u2013 in very hot conditions. Sabatini was sidelined for six weeks by the injury, returning to the tour in mid-March and winning her first tournament back \u2013 the Virginia Slims of Florida \u2013 without the loss of a set. She reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon, losing to eventual champion Martina Navratilova, in straight sets. At the US Open, Sabatini progressed to her second Grand Slam final where she defeated world No. 1 Graf in straight sets 6\u20132, 7\u20136 to win the title, having saved two set points against her while 5-6 down in the second set. She credited her win with being more aggressive and coming to the net whenever she could to attack Graf's shorter balls. Sabatini also beat Graf in the semifinals of the WTA Championships in Madison Square Garden later that year, losing in the final to Monica Seles, 6\u20134, 5\u20137, 3\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20132. It was the first five-set match to be played on the women's tour since 1901.</s><s>Career.:1991: Wimbledon final. Sabatini won five tournaments in the first half####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of the year. She beat three top five players (Graf, Navratilova and Fernandez) on her way to winning the title in Tokyo, and beat Graf on three further occasions in Boca Raton, Key Biscayne and Amelia Island. In the Italian Open final, Sabatini defeated world no. 1 Seles for the loss of just five games. She reached the semifinals at Roland Garros (saving two match points in defeating Jana Novotna in the quarter finals) and then her third Grand Slam singles final at Wimbledon, where she lost to Graf 4\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20138 (having served for the match twice). Sabatini came close to attaining the world No. 1 ranking in 1991, but was narrowly denied by Graf and then Monica Seles. All three players' rankings were within a few points of each other for much of the year. Her year was capped by receiving the WTA Most Improved Player of the Year award.</s><s>Career.:1992. Sabatini reached eight finals and won five titles, including her fourth Italian Open (where she beat world No. 1 Seles in the final again), Amelia Island (defeating Graf in the final) and Hilton####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Head. She also reached the semifinal stage at three of the four grand slams:- the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon; and a quarterfinal at the US Open.</s><s>Career.:1993. At the Australian Open, Sabatini reached the semifinals, saving three match points in the quarterfinals against Mary Pierce to defeat her 4\u20136, 7\u20136, 6\u20130, before losing to eventual champion, Seles. She reached consecutive finals at the Italian Open and German Open during the clay-court season. At the French Open in June, Sabatini lost to Mary Jo Fernandez in the quarterfinals 8\u201310 in the final set, in what was \u2013 at the time \u2013 the third longest match in Open Era tennis, having led 5\u20131 in the second set. Sabatini also reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, and at the US Open where she lost to Graf in three sets. That year in May, following the stabbing attack of Monica Seles in the WTA Hamburg tournament, a vote among the top players was held by the tour organisers to decide whether Seles should be allowed to have her world no. 1 ranking protected while recovering from the knife attack. Of the 17 players voting, all players voted against protecting####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Seles' ranking, apart from Sabatini (who abstained). Despite the vote result, Seles was eventually granted a joint No. 1 ranking (with Graf) upon her return to the tour two years later.</s><s>Career.:1994: WTA Finals champion. In 1994, Sabatini reached the finals of Amelia Island and Strasbourg, and the semifinals of both the Australian Open and US Open. Across 15 consecutive Grand Slam events from Wimbledon 1990 to Australian Open 1994, she did not lose before the quarterfinal stage; this was the third longest streak of consecutive quarterfinal Grand Slam appearances in women's tennis ever (behind Graf and Navratilova tied on 19). In November, Sabatini defeated Lindsay Davenport in the final of the WTA Championships in New York to win her second title at that tournament. In the first round, she beat world No. 6, Martina Navratilova, in what was Navratilova's last match before retirement.</s><s>Career.:1995. Sabatini won the title at the Sydney International, defeating Davenport in the final in straight sets. As well as the reaching a record seventh final in the Amelia Island Championships and her third final at the Porsche Tennis####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Grand Prix, she also reached the quarterfinals of both the French Open and Wimbledon, and the semifinals of the US Open (where she lost to eventual champion Graf 4\u20136, 6\u20137). Their semifinal was the 40th and final match between the pair, in which Graf led 29\u201311. Sabatini's 11 wins meant she had defeated Graf more times than any other player ever managed to defeat her.</s><s>Career.:1996: injury and retirement. Sabatini missed several months of the season due to a pulled stomach muscle injury. In New York in October, she announced her retirement from professional tennis. At the end of the year, she received the WTA Diamond Aces Award (given to the player considered to have done the most to promote tennis both on and off the court). From 1986 until her five-month injury absence in 1996, Sabatini spent 508 consecutive weeks within the world's top 10. This remains the fourth longest top-10 streak among any player in WTA-tour history. She spent 312 of those weeks in the world's top five, and finished six consecutive seasons with a top-5 ranking. Sabatini reached the semifinal stage or better in Grand Slam championships on 18####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### occasions in singles and 14 times in doubles, and reached at least one Grand Slam singles semifinal for 11 consecutive years. She defeated the reigning world No. 1 on ten occasions (Graf seven times, Seles twice and Navratilova once) during her career. Sabatini won the Diamond Konex Award in 2000 as the most distinguished \"Sportsperson of the Decade\" in Argentina, and in July 2006 she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.</s><s>Personal life. In the late 1980s, Sabatini launched a line of fragrances after partnering with the German perfume company M\u00fclhens. Her signature scent debuted in 1989. Since retiring, she has continued to promote her lines of perfumes. In 1992, Sabatini became the first ever tennis player to have a rose named after her, an orange-red bloom. Great American Doll Company created a doll in Sabatini's likeness in 1994, dressed in tennis attire. That same year, Sabatini published a motivational book entitled \"My Story\". In 2003, she obtained Italian citizenship \"jus sanguinis\" through her paternal great-grandfather \u2013 David Sabatini \u2013 who was born in Potenza Picena in Central Italy, and imm####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####igrated to Argentina at the end of the 19th century with his wife Rosa Vivani. A statue of Sabatini was unveiled in central Buenos Aires by Mauricio Macri in 2014. Within weeks of its unveiling, however, the bronze-coloured racket was stolen from the statue's grip. The statue is placed alongside memorials to other Argentinian sports stars including Lionel Messi, Diego Maradona, Guillermo Vilas and Roberto de Vicenzo. Sabatini was awarded the International Club's prestigious Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award in 2017 in recognition of both the sportsmanship she demonstrated throughout her career, and for her charitable projects post-retirement. She received the award from Rod Laver at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships. In 2019, the ITF presented Sabatini with its highest accolade, the Philippe Chatrier Award, for her achievements both during her tennis career and post-retirement charity work, specifically her work involving UNICEF, UNESCO, the Special Olympics, and as an 'Athlete Role Model' at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games.

His death was seen as a largely political venture on the part of government officials in their attempt to stamp out dissent and crush religious freedom in the area. He was dubbed \"Joselito.\" He was declared to be venerable on June 22, 2004, by Pope John Paul II and was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI \u2013 through the Cardinal-Prefect of the Congregation of the Causes of Saints \u2013 on November 20, 2005, in Mexico. Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to him on January 21, 2016, allowing for his canonization to take place; a date was determined at a consistory on March 15, 2016, and he was proclaimed to be a saint on October 16, 2016.</s><s>Background. The Cristero War began when the government began eliminating church privileges and seizing church properties throughout the country, in accordance with anti-clerical laws written into the Mexican Constitution. President Plutarco Elias Calles, who took office in 1924, focused on the Roman Catholic####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Church, which led to seizure of church property, the closing of religious schools and convents, and the exile or the execution of priests.</s><s>Life and Cristero War. Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez del R\u00edo was born on March 28, 1913, in Sahuayo, Michoac\u00e1n. He attended school first in his hometown, then in Guadalajara in Jalisco. When the Cristero War broke out in 1926, his brothers joined the rebel forces, but his mother would not allow him to take part. The rebel general, Prudencio Mendoza Alcazar, also refused his enlistment. The boy insisted that he wanted the chance to give his life for Jesus Christ and so come to Heaven easily. Mendoza relented and allowed Jos\u00e9 to become the flagbearer of the troop. The Cristeros nicknamed him Tarcisius, after the early Christian saint who was martyred for protecting the Eucharist from desecration. During heavy fighting on January 25, 1928, a soldier named Mendoza had his horse killed and Jos\u00e9 gave his horse to the man so that he could flee. Then he sought cover and fired at the enemy until he ran out of ammunition. The government####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### troops captured the boy and imprisoned him.</s><s>Life and Cristero War.:Torture and death. It was later reported that Jos\u00e9 was captured by government forces, who ordered him to renounce his faith in Christ, under threat of death. He refused to accept apostasy. To break his resolve, he was made to watch the hanging of another Cristero that they had in custody, but instead Jos\u00e9 encouraged the man, saying that they would soon meet again in Heaven after death. In prison, Jos\u00e9 prayed the Rosary daily and wrote an emotional letter to his mother, saying that he was ready to fulfill the will of God to whom he dedicated himself. His father attempted to raise a ransom to save him, but was not able to appease the government in time to do so, thus failing to secure the release of his son. Others recalled the gruesome events that transpired after the government's failure to break Jos\u00e9's resolve on the evening of February 10, 1928: \"Consequently they cut the bottom of his feet and obliged him to walk around the town toward the cemetery. They also at times cut him with a machete until he was bleeding from several wounds. He cried and moaned with pain, but he did not give in. At times they####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### stopped him and said, 'If you shout, \"Death to Christ the King\" we will spare your life'. Jos\u00e9 would only shout, 'I will never give in. Viva Cristo Rey!'\"</s><s>Life and Cristero War.:Burial and relics. The remains of Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez del R\u00edo are enshrined above a side altar in the Church of Saint James the Apostle in Sahuayo, his hometown.</s><s>Sainthood. The sainthood proceedings opened in Zamora on May 1, 1996 in a diocesan process that continued until October 25, 1996. A week prior to the conclusion of that phase the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared \"nihil obstat\" (nothing against) to the cause on October 21, 1996; this granted him the title Servant of God, the first stage in the sainthood process. The process was later ratified on November 29, 2002, and allowed for officials to draft and submit in 2003 the Positio on his martyrdom. Pope John Paul II approved the findings on June 22, 2004, thus allowing his beatification. He was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on November 20, 2005, in Mexico; the Cardinal-Prefect of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Congregation for the Causes of Saints presided on behalf of the pontiff.

It was investigated on a local level in Mexico and concluded its work on January 30, 2015. A medical board approved it in 2015 while theologians did so as well on October 8, 2015; the C.C.S. granted final approval on January 12, 2016, before submitting it to the pope for his approval. Pope Francis approved the miracle as being directly attributed to his intercession on January 21, 2016, and the pope confirmed at an ordinary consistory of cardinals on March 15, 2016, the date of which he would be elevated to sainthood.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Paul Kruger Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (; 10 October 1825\u00a0\u2013 14 July 1904) was a South African politician. He was one of the dominant political and military figures in 19th-century South Africa, and State President of the South African Republic (or Transvaal) from 1883 to 1900. Nicknamed \"Oom Paul\" (\"Uncle Paul\"), he came to international prominence as the face of the Boer cause\u2014that of the Transvaal and its neighbour the Orange Free State\u2014against Britain during the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902. He has been called a personification of Afrikanerdom, and remains a controversial figure; admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero. Born near the eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no education apart from the Bible. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas Fran\u00e7ois Burgers. Kruger was appointed Vice President in March 1877, shortly before the South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. Over the next three years he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned. He became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the First Boer War of 1880\u20131881. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the London Convention, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a completely independent state. Following the influx of thousands of predominantly British settlers with the Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1886, \"uitlanders\" (foreigners) provided almost all of the South African Republic's tax revenues but lacked civic representation; Boer burghers retained control of the government. The uitlander problem and the associated tensions with Britain dominated Kruger's attention for the rest of his presidency, to which he was re-elected in 1888, 1893 and 1898, and led to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Jameson Raid of 1895\u20131896 and ultimately the Second Boer War. Kruger left for Europe as the war turned against the Boers in 1900 and spent the rest of his life in exile, refusing to return home following the British victory. After he died in Switzerland at the age of 78 in 1904, his body was returned to South Africa for a state funeral, and buried in the Heroes' Acre in Pretoria.</s><s>Early life.</s><s>Early life.:Family and childhood. Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger was born on 10 October 1825 at Bulhoek, a farm in the Steynsburg area of the Cape Colony, the third child and second son of Casper Jan Hendrik Kruger (1801\u20131852), a farmer, and his wife Elsje (Elisa; \"n\u00e9e\" Steyn; 1806\u20131834). The family was of Dutch-speaking Afrikaner background, of German, French Huguenot and Dutch stock. Also counted amongst its ancestry was some Khoi blood, which came down to it from his ancestress Krotoa. The Kruger paternal ancestors had been in South Africa since 1713, when Jacob Kr\u00fcger, from Berlin, arrived in Cape####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Town as a 17-year-old soldier in the Dutch East India Company's service. Jacob's children dropped the umlaut from the family name, a common practice among South Africans of German origin. Over the following generations, Kruger's paternal forebears moved into the interior. His mother's family, the Steyns, had lived in South Africa since 1668 and were relatively affluent and cultured by Cape standards. Kruger's great-granduncle Hermanus Steyn had been president of the self-declared Republic of Swellendam that revolted against Company rule in 1795. Bulhoek, Kruger's birthplace, was the Steyn family farm and had been Elsie's home since early childhood; her father Douw Gerbrand Steyn had settled there in 1809. The Kruger and Steyn families were acquainted and Casper occasionally visited Bulhoek as a young man. He and Elsie married in Cradock in 1820, when he was 19 and she was 14. A girl, Sophia, and a boy, Douw Gerbrand, were born before Paul was born in 1825. His first two names, Stephanus Johannes, were chosen after his paternal grandfather, but rarely used. The provenance of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### third given name, Paulus, \"was to remain rather a mystery\", Johannes Meintjes wrote in his 1974 biography of Kruger, \"and yet the boy was always called Paul.\" Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826. Soon thereafter his parents acquired a farm of their own to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother died when he was eight; his father Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (\"n\u00e9e\" du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, the only education Kruger received was three months of study under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father. In adulthood, Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from the Bible.</s><s>Early life.:Great Trek. In 1835 Casper Kruger, his father, and his brothers Gert and Theuns moved their families east and set up farms near the Caledon River, on the Cape Colony's far north-eastern frontier. The Cape had been under British sovereignty since 1814, when the Netherlands####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### ceded it to Britain with the Convention of London. Boer discontent with aspects of British rule, such as the institution of English as the sole official language and the abolition of slavery in 1834, led to the Great Trek\u2014a mass migration by Dutch-speaking \"Voortrekkers\" north-east from the Cape to the land on the far side of the Orange and Vaal rivers. Many Boers had been expressing displeasure with the British Cape administration for some time, but the Krugers were comparatively content. They had always co-operated with the British, and had not owned slaves. They had given little thought to the idea of leaving the Cape. A group of emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter passed through the Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer republic with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey, the trekkers made improvised classrooms, marking them with reeds and grass. The more educated em####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####igrants took turns in teaching. The Voortrekkers faced indigenous competition for the area they were entering from Mzilikazi and his Ndebele (or Matabele) people, a branch from the Zulu Kingdom to the south-east. On 16 October 1836 the 11-year-old Kruger took part in the Battle of Vegkop, where Potgieter's laager, a circle of wagons chained together, was unsuccessfully attacked by Mzilikazi and around 4,000\u20136,000 Matabele warriors. Kruger and the other small children assisted in tasks such as bullet-casting, while the women and larger boys helped the fighting men, of whom there were about 40. Kruger could recall the battle in great detail and give a vivid account well into old age. During 1837 and 1838 Kruger's family was part of the Voortrekker group under Potgieter that trekked further east into Natal. Here they met the American missionary Daniel Lindley, who gave young Paul much spiritual invigoration. The Zulu King Dingane concluded a land treaty with Potgieter. But he reconsidered and massacred first Piet Retief's party of settlers, then others####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### at Weenen. Kruger later recounted his family's group coming under attack from Zulus soon after the Retief massacre, describing \"children pinioned to their mothers' breasts by spears, or with their brains dashed out on waggon wheels\". But \"God heard our prayer\", he recalled, and \"we followed them and shot them down as they fled, until more of them were dead than those of us they had killed in their attack\u00a0... I could shoot moderately well for we lived, so to speak, among the game.\" Because of the attacks, the Krugers returned to the highveld, where they took part in Potgieter's campaign that forced Mzilikazi to move his people north, across the Limpopo River, to what became Matabeleland. Kruger and his father settled at the foot of the Magaliesberg mountains in the Transvaal. In Natal Andries Pretorius defeated more than 10,000 of Dingane's Zulus at the Battle of Blood River on 16 December 1838, a date subsequently marked by the Boers as the Day of the Vow.</s><s>Early life.:Burgher. Boer tradition of the time dictated that men were entitled to choose two farms####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\u2014one for crops and one for grazing\u2014upon becoming enfranchised burghers at the age of 16. Kruger set up his home at the farm Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg in the Magaliesberg area. Kruger later became the owner of a piece of farmland named Waterkloof, on 30 September 1842. This concluded, he wasted little time in pursuing the hand of Maria du Plessis, the daughter of a fellow Voortrekker south of the Vaal; she was only 14 years old when they married in Potchefstroom in 1842. The same year Kruger was elected a deputy field cornet\u2014\"a singular honour at seventeen\", Meintjes comments. This role combined the civilian duties of a local magistrate with a military rank equivalent to that of a junior commissioned officer. Kruger was already an accomplished frontiersman, horseman, and guerrilla fighter. In addition to his native Dutch, he could speak basic English and several African languages, some fluently. He had shot a lion for the first time when he was a boy\u2014in old age he recalled being 14, but Meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11. During his many hunting excursions####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, Kruger was nearly killed on several occasions. In 1845, while he was hunting rhinoceros along the Steelpoort River, his four-bore elephant gun exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb. Kruger wrapped the wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp, where he treated it with turpentine. He refused calls to have the hand amputated by a doctor, and instead cut off the remains of the injured thumb himself with a pocketknife. When gangrenous marks appeared on his arm up to his shoulder, he placed the hand in the stomach of a freshly killed goat, a traditional Boer remedy. He considered this a success\u2014\"when it came to the turn of the second goat, my hand was already easier and the danger much less.\" The wound took more than six months to heal, but he did not wait that long to start hunting again. Britain annexed the Voortrekkers' short-lived Natalia Republic in 1843 as the Colony of Natal. Pretorius briefly led Boer resistance to this, but before long most of the Boers in Natal had trekked back north-west to the area around the Orange and Vaal rivers. In 1845 Kruger was a member####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of Potgieter's expedition to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique to negotiate a frontier with Portugal; the Lebombo Mountains was settled upon as the border between Boer and Portuguese lands. Maria and their first child died of fever in January 1846. In 1847 Kruger married her cousin, Gezina du Plessis, from the Colesberg area. Their first child, Casper Jan Hendrik, was born on 22 December that year. Concerned by the exodus of so many whites from the Cape and Natal, and taking the view that the Boers remained British subjects, the British Governor Sir Harry Smith in 1848 annexed the area between the Orange and Vaal rivers as the \"Orange River Sovereignty\". Pretorius led a Boer commando raid against this, and they were defeated by Smith at the Battle of Boomplaats. Like the Krugers, Pretorius lived in the Magaliesberg mountains and often hosted the young Kruger, who greatly admired the elder man's resolve, sophistication, and piety. A warm relationship developed. \"Kruger's political awareness can be dated from 1850\", Meintjes writes, \"and it was in no small measure given to him by Pretorius.\" Like Pret####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####orius, Kruger wanted to centralise the emigrants under a single authority and win British recognition for their territory as an independent state. This last point was not due to hostility to Britain\u2014neither Pretorius nor Kruger was particularly anti-British\u2014but because they perceived the emigrants' unity as under threat if the Cape administration continued to regard them as British subjects. Henry Douglas Warden, the British Resident in the Orange River area, advised Smith in 1851 that he thought a compromise should be attempted with Pretorius. Smith sent representatives to meet him at the Sand River. Kruger, aged 26, accompanied Pretorius and on 17 January 1852 was present at the conclusion of the Sand River Convention, under which Britain recognised \"the Emigrant Farmers\" in the Transvaal as independent: they called themselves the \"Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek\" (\"South African Republic\"). In exchange for the Boers' pledge not to introduce slavery in the Transvaal, the British agreed not to make an alliance with any \"coloured nations\" there. Kruger's uncle Gert was also present; his father Casper would have been as well but he was ill and unable to attend.</s><s>Early life.:Field cornet. The Bo####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ers and the local Tswana and Basotho chiefdoms were in near-constant conflict, mainly over land. Kruger was elected field cornet of his district in 1852, and in August that year he took part in the Battle of Dimawe, a raid against the Tswana chief Sechele I. The Boer commando was headed by Pretorius, but in practice he did not take much part as he was suffering from dropsy (edema). Kruger narrowly escaped death twice\u2014first a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head but knocked him out without cutting him; later a Tswana bullet swiped across his chest, tearing his jacket but not wounding him. The commando wrecked David Livingstone's mission station at Kolobeng, destroying his medicines and books. Livingstone was away at the time. Kruger's version of the story was that the Boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in Livingstone's house and, interpreting this as a breach of Britain's promise at the Sand River not to arm tribal chiefs, confiscated them. Whatever the truth, Livingstone wrote about the Boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter, depicting them as mindless barbarians. Livingstone and many others criticised####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Boers for abducting women and children from tribal settlements and taking them home to work as slaves. The Boers argued that they did not keep these captives as slaves but as \"inboekelings\"\u2014indentured \"apprentices\" who, having lost their families, were given bed, board and training in a Boer household until reaching adulthood. Modern scholarship widely dismisses this as a technical ruse by the Boers to enforce a means of inexpensive labour for them while avoiding overt slavery. Gezina Kruger had an \"inboekeling\" maid for whom she eventually arranged marriage, and paid her a dowry. Having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant (between field cornet and commandant), Kruger formed part of a commando sent against the chief Montshiwa in December 1852 to recover some stolen cattle. Pretorius was still sick, and only nominally in command. Seven months later, on 23 July 1853, Pretorius died, aged 54. Just before the end he sent for Kruger, but the young man arrived too late. Meintjes says that Pretorius \"was perhaps the first person to recognise that behind [Kruger's] rough exterior was a most singular person with an intellect all####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the more remarkable for being almost entirely self-developed\".</s><s>Commandant. Pretorius did not name a successor as Commandant-General; his eldest son, Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, was appointed in his stead. The younger Pretorius elevated Kruger to the rank of commandant. Pretorius, the son, claimed power over not just the Transvaal but also the Orange River area\u2014he said the British had promised it to his father\u2014but virtually nobody, not even supporters like Kruger, accepted this. Following Sir George Cathcart's replacement of Smith as governor in Cape Town, the British policy towards the Orange River Sovereignty changed to the extent that the British were willing to pull out and grant independence to a second Boer republic there. This was in spite of the fact that in addition to the Boer settlers, there were many English-speaking colonists who wanted rule from the Cape to continue. On 23 February 1854 Sir George Russell Clerk signed the Orange River Convention, ending the sovereignty and recognising what the Boers dubbed the \"Oranje-Vrijstaat\" (\"Orange Free State\"). Bloemfontein, the former British garrison town, became the Free State's capital; the Transvaal seat of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### government became Pretoria, named after the elder Pretorius. The South African Republic was in practice split between the south-west and central Transvaal, where most of Pretorius' supporters were, and regionalist factions in the Zoutpansberg, Lydenburg and Utrecht districts that viewed any central authority with suspicion. Kruger's first campaign as a commandant was in the latter part of 1854, against the chiefs Mapela and Makapan near the Waterberg. The chiefs retreated into what became called the Caves of Makapan (\"Makapansgat\") with many of their people and cattle, and a siege ensued in which thousands of the defenders died, mainly from starvation. When Commandant-General Piet Potgieter of Zoutpansberg was shot dead, Kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve the body and was almost killed himself.</s><s>Commandant.:Mediator. Marthinus Pretorius hoped to achieve either federation or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, but before he could contemplate this he would have to unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man constitutional commission, including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpans####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####berg rejected the proposals, calling for a less centralised government. Pretorius tried again during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but Stephanus Schoeman, Zoutpansberg's new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts. The constitution settled upon formalised a national Volksraad (parliament) and created an executive council, headed by a president. Pretorius was sworn in as the first president of the South African Republic on 6 January 1857. Kruger successfully proposed Schoeman for the post of national Commandant-General, hoping to thereby end the factional disputes and foster unity, but Schoeman categorically refused to serve under this constitution or Pretorius. With the Transvaal on the verge of civil war, tensions also rose with the Orange Free State after Pretorius's ambitions of absorbing it became widely known. Kruger had strong personal reservations about Pretorius, not considering him his father's equal, but nevertheless remained steadfastly loyal to him. After the Free State government dismissed an ultimatum from Pretorius to cease what he regarded as the marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough and that they would have to make terms. With Pretorius's approval, Kruger met Boshoff under a white flag. Kruger made clear that he personally disapproved of Pretorius's actions and the situation as a whole, but defended his president when the Free Staters began to speak harshly of him. A commission of 12 men from each republic, including Kruger, reached a compromise whereby Pretorius would drop his claim on the Free State, and a treaty was concluded on 2 June 1857. Over the next year Kruger helped to negotiate a peace agreement between the Free State and Moshoeshoe I of the Basotho, and persuaded Schoeman to take part in successful talks regarding constitutional revisions, after which Zoutpansberg accepted the central government with Schoeman as commandant-general.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### On 28 June 1858 Schoeman appointed Kruger Assistant Commandant-General of the South African Republic. \"All in all\", Kruger's biographer T\u00a0R\u00a0H Davenport comments, \"he had shown a loyalty to authority in political disputes, devotion to duty as an officer, and a real capacity for power play.\"</s><s>Commandant.:Forming the \"Dopper Church\". Kruger considered Providence his guide in life and referred to scripture constantly; he knew large sections of the Bible by heart. He understood the biblical texts literally and inferred from them that the Earth was flat, a belief he retained firmly to his dying day. At mealtimes he said grace twice, at length and in formal Dutch rather than the South African dialect that was to become Afrikaans. In late 1858, when he returned to Boekenhoutskloof, he was mentally and physically drained following the exertions of the past few years and in the midst of a spiritual crisis. Hoping to establish a personal relationship with God, he ventured into the Magaliesberg and spent several days without food or water. A search party found him \"nearly dead from hunger and thirst\", Davenport records. The experience reinvigorated him and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### greatly intensified his faith, which for the rest of his life was unshakeable and, according to Meintjes, perceived by some of his contemporaries as like that of a child. Kruger belonged to the \"Doppers\"\u2014a group of about 6,000 that followed an extremely strict interpretation of traditional Calvinist doctrine. They based their theology almost entirely on the Old Testament and, among other things, wished to eschew hymns and organs and read only from the Psalms. When the 1859 synod of the \"Nederduits Hervormde Kerk van Afrika\" (NHK), the main church in the Transvaal, decided to enforce the singing of modern hymns, Kruger led a group of Doppers that denounced the NHK as \"deluded\" and \"false\" and left its Rustenburg congregation. They formed the \"Gereformeerde Kerke van Zuid-Afrika\" (GK), thereafter known informally as the \"Dopper Church\", and recruited the Reverend Dirk Postma, a like-minded traditionalist recently arrived from the Netherlands, to be their minister. This act also had secular ramifications as according to the 1858 constitution only NHK members could take part in public affairs####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####.</s><s>Commandant.:Civil war; Commandant-General. In late 1859 Pretorius was invited to stand for president in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly as a means to overcome the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year's leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for Bloemfontein, appointing Johannes Hermanus Grobler to be acting president in his absence. Pretorius was sworn in as president of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day. Kruger and others in the Transvaal government disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency, and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Pretorius was told by the Transvaal volksraad on 10 September 1860 to choose between his two posts\u2014to the surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in the Free State. After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant Grobler as Acting President, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg was appointed Acting President while a new election was organised for October 1862. Having returned home, Kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting his presence in the capital, the volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate; he replied that he was pleased to be summoned but his membership in the Dopper Church meant he could not enter politics. Van Rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all Reformed denominations. Schoeman mustered a commando at Potchefstroom, but was routed by Kruger on the night of 9 October 1862. After Schoeman returned with a larger force Kruger and Pretorius held negotiations where it was agreed to hold a special court on the disturbances in January 1863, and soon thereafter fresh elections for president and commandant-general. Schoeman was found guilty of rebellion against the state and banished. In May the election results were announced\u2014Van Rensburg became president, with Kruger####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### as commandant-general. Both expressed disappointment at the low turnout and resolved to hold another set of elections. Van Rensburg's opponent this time was Pretorius, who had resigned his office in the Orange Free State and returned to the Transvaal. Turnout was higher and on 12 October the volksraad announced another Van Rensburg victory. Kruger was returned as commandant-general with a large majority. The civil war ended with Kruger's victory over Jan Viljoen's commando, raised in support of Pretorius and Schoeman, at the Crocodile River on 5 January 1864. Elections were held yet again, and this time Pretorius defeated Van Rensburg. Kruger was re-elected as commandant-general with over two-thirds of the vote. The civil war had led to an economic collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus to the east and war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right. In 1867, Pretoria sent Kruger to restore law and order in Zoutpansberg. He had around 500 men but very low reserves of ammunition, and discipline in the ranks was poor. On reaching Schoemansdal, which was under threat by the chief Katlakter, Kruger and his officers resolved that holding the town was impossible and ordered a general evacuation, following which Katlakter razed the town. The loss of Schoemansdal, once a prosperous settlement by Boer standards####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, was considered a great humiliation by many burghers. The Transvaal government formally exonerated Kruger over the matter, ruling that he had been forced to evacuate Schoemansdal by factors beyond his control, but some still argued that he had given the town up too readily. Peace returned to Zoutpansberg in 1869, following the intervention of the republic's Swazi allies. Pretorius stepped down as president in November 1871. In the 1872 election Kruger's preferred candidate, William Robinson, was decisively defeated by the Reverend Thomas Fran\u00e7ois Burgers, a church minister from the Cape who was noted for his eloquent preaching but controversial for some because of his liberal interpretation of the scriptures. He did not believe in the Devil, for example. Kruger publicly accepted Burgers's election, announcing at his inauguration that \"as a good republican\" he submitted to the vote of the majority, but he had grave personal reservations regarding the new president. He particularly disliked Burgers's new education law, which restricted children's religious instruction to outside school hours\u2014in Kruger's view an affront to God. This, coupled with the sickness of Gezina and their children with malaria, caused Kruger to lose interest in his office. In May 18####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####73 he requested an honourable discharge from his post, which Burgers promptly granted. The office of commandant-general was abolished the following week. Kruger moved his main residence to Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg, and for a time absented himself from public affairs.</s><s>Diamonds and deputations.</s><s>Diamonds and deputations.:Under Burgers. Burgers busied himself attempting to modernise the South African Republic along European lines, hoping to set in motion a process that would lead to a united, independent South Africa. Finding Boer officialdom inadequate, he imported ministers and civil servants en masse from the Netherlands. His ascent to the presidency came shortly after the realisation that the Boer republics might stand on land of immense mineral wealth. Diamonds had been discovered in Griqua territory just north of the Orange River on the western edge of the Free State, arousing the interest of Britain and other countries; mostly British settlers, referred to by the Boers as uitlanders (\"out-landers\"), were flooding into the region. Britain began to pursue federation (at that time often referred to as \"confederation\") of the Boer republics with the Cape and Natal and in 1873, over Boer####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### objections, annexed the area surrounding the huge diamond mine at Kimberley, dubbing it Griqualand West. Some Doppers preferred to embark on another trek, north-west across the Kalahari Desert towards Angola, rather than live under Burgers. This became the Dorsland Trek of 1874. The emigrants asked Kruger to lead the way, but he refused to take part. In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay and said he would go to Europe to raise the necessary funds. By the time he left in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council. In 1876 hostilities broke out with the Bapedi people under Sekhukhune. Burgers had told the Acting President Piet Joubert not to fight a war in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile commandant-general refused. Burg####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail\u2014particularly if the President rode with the commando, which he was determined to do. \"I cannot lead the commando if you come\", Kruger said, \"for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot me behind the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition.\" Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of \"volunteers\" under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate. With Burgers due to stand for re-election the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately assured him that he would do his utmost to defend the South African Republic's independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### trade gathered pace, and the idea of annexation was gaining support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 Lord Carnarvon, Colonial Secretary under Benjamin Disraeli, gave Sir Theophilus Shepstone of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic's government and, if he saw fit, annex the country.</s><s>Diamonds and deputations.:British annexation; first and second deputations. Shepstone arrived in Pretoria in January 1877. He outlined criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and expressed support for federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances\u2014Kruger and the State Attorney E\u00a0J\u00a0P Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, one of which was that Pretoria tolerated slavery\u2014Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of vice-president. The impression of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Kruger garnered by the British envoys in Pretoria during early 1877 was one of an unspeakably vulgar, bigoted backveld peasant. Regarding his austere, weather-beaten face, greying hair and simple Dopper dress of a short-cut black jacket, baggy trousers and a black top hat, they considered him extremely ugly. Furthermore, they found his personal habits, such as copious spitting, revolting. Shepstone's legal adviser William Morcom was one of the first British officials to write about Kruger: calling him \"gigantically horrible\", he recounted a public luncheon at which Kruger dined with a dirty pipe protruding from his pocket and such greasy hair that he spent part of the meal combing it. According to Martin Meredith, Kruger's unsightliness was mentioned in British reports \"so often that it became shorthand for his whole personality, and indeed, his objectives\". They did not consider him a major threat to British ambitions. Shepstone had the Transvaal's annexation as a British territory formally announced in Pretoria on 11 April 1877. Burgers resigned and returned to the Cape to live in retirement\u2014his last act as president was to announce the government's decision to send a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### deputation, headed by Kruger and Jorissen, to London to make an official protest. He exhorted the burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to the British until these diplomats returned. Jorissen, one of the Dutch officials recently imported by Burgers, was included at Kruger's request because of his wide knowledge of European languages (Kruger was not confident in his English); a second Dutchman, Willem Eduard Bok, accompanied them as secretary. They left in May 1877, travelling first to Bloemfontein to confer with the Free State government, then on to Kimberley and Worcester, where the 51-year-old Kruger boarded a train for the first time in his life. In Cape Town, where his German ancestor had landed 164 years before, he had his first sight of the sea. During the voyage to England Kruger encountered a 19-year-old law student from the Orange Free State named Martinus Theunis Steyn. Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, in their eyes more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies and the structure of the universe, he inter####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####jected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, he might as well throw his Bible overboard. At the Colonial Office in Whitehall, Carnarvon and Kruger's own colleagues were astonished when, speaking through interpreters, he rose to what Meintjes calls \"remarkable heights of oratory\", averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal. His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of \"a handful of irreconcilables\". Carnarvon dismissed Kruger's idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain. Kruger did not meet Queen Victoria, though such an audience is described in numerous anecdotes, depicted in films and sometimes reported as fact. Between August and October he visited the Netherlands and Germany, where he aroused little general public interest, but made a potent impact in the Reformed congregations he visited. After a brief sojourn back in England he returned to South Africa and arrived at Boekenhoutfontein shortly before Christmas 1877. He found a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### national awakening occurring. \"Paradoxically\", John Laband writes, \"British occupation seemed to be fomenting a sense of national consciousness in the Transvaal which years of fractious independence had failed to elicit.\" When Kruger visited Pretoria in January 1878 he was greeted by a procession that took him to a mass gathering in Church Square. Attempting to stir up the crowd, Kruger said that since Carnarvon had told him the annexation would not be revoked he could not see what more they could do. The gambit worked; burghers began shouting that they would sooner die fighting for their country than submit to the British. According to Meintjes, Kruger was still not particularly anti-British; he thought the British had made a mistake and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure\u2014587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against\u2014he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council. Carnarvon had been succeeded as colonial secretary by Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who received the deputation coldly. After Bok gave a lengthy opening declaration, Hicks Beach muttered: \"Have you ever heard of an instance where the British Lion has ever given up anything on which he had set his paw?\" Kruger retorted: \"Yes. The Orange Free State.\" The deputation remained in London for some weeks thereafter, communicating by correspondence with Hicks Beach, who eventually reaffirmed Carnarvon's decision that the annexation would not be revoked. The deputation attempted to rally support for their cause, as the first mission had done, but with the Eastern Question dominating the political scene few were interested. One English sympathiser gave Kruger a gold ring, bearing the inscription: \"Take courage, your cause is just and must triumph in the end.\" Kruger was touched and wore it for the rest of his life. Like its predecessor, the second deputation went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany. In Paris, where the 1878 \"Exposition Universelle\" was in progress, Kruger saw a hot air####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### balloon for the first time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. \"High up in mid-air\", he recalled, \"I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as we had gone so far, to take me all the way home.\" The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal \"to remind me of my journey through the air\". The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an open letter in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation.</s><s>Diamonds and deputations.:Drive for independence. Kruger and Joubert returned home to find the British and the Zulus were close to war. Shepstone had supported the Zulus in a border dispute with the South African Republic, but then, after annexing the Transvaal, changed his mind and endorsed the Boer claim. Meeting Sir Bartle Frere and Lord Chelmsford at Pietermaritzburg on 28 November 1878, Kruger happily gave tactical guidance for the British campaign\u2014he advised the use of Boer tactics####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, making laagers at every stop and constantly scouting ahead\u2014but refused Frere's request that he accompany one of the British columns, saying he would only help if assurances were made regarding the Transvaal. Chelmsford thought the campaign would be a \"promenade\" and did not take Kruger's advice. Soon after he entered Zululand in January 1879, starting the Anglo-Zulu War, his unlaagered central column was surprised by Cetshwayo's Zulus at Isandlwana and almost totally destroyed. The war in Zululand effectively ended on 4 July 1879 with Chelmsford's decisive victory at the Zulu capital Ulundi. Around the same time the British appointed a new Governor and High Commissioner for the Transvaal and Natal, Sir Garnet Wolseley, who introduced a new Transvaal constitution giving the Boers a limited degree of self-government. Wolseley blunted the Zulu military threat by splitting the kingdom into 13 chiefdoms, and crushed Sekhukhune and the Bapedi during late 1879. He had little success in winning the Boers over to the idea of federation; his defeat of the Zulus and the Baped####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####i had the opposite effect, as with these two long-standing threats to security removed the Transvaalers could focus all their efforts against the British. Most Boers refused to co-operate with Wolseley's new order; Kruger declined a seat in the new executive council. At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, many of them bearing the republic's \"vierkleur\" (\"four-colour\") flag, voted to pursue a restored, independent republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then\u2014Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign. In early 1880 Hicks Beach forwarded a scheme for South African federation to the Cape Parliament. Kruger travelled to the Cape to agitate against the proposals alongside Joubert and Jorissen; by the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### time they arrived the Liberals had won an election victory in Britain and Gladstone was prime minister. In Cape Town, Paarl and elsewhere Kruger lobbied vigorously against the annexation and won much sympathy. Davenport suggests that this contributed to the federation plan's withdrawal, which in turn weakened the British resolve to keep the Transvaal. Kruger and Joubert wrote to Gladstone asking him to restore the South African Republic's independence, but to their astonishment the prime minister replied in June 1880 that he feared withdrawing from the Transvaal might lead to chaos across South Africa. Kruger concluded that they had done all they could to try to regain independence peacefully, and over the following months the Transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion. Wolseley was replaced as governor and high commissioner by Sir George Pomeroy Colley. In the last months of 1880, Lanyon began to pursue tax payments from burghers who were in arrears. Piet Cronj\u00e9, a farmer in the Potchefstroom district, gave his local landdrost a written statement that the burghers would pay taxes to their \"legal government\"\u2014that of the South African Republic\u2014but not to the British \"usurper\" administration. Kruger and Cronj\u00e9 knew each####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### other; the writer Johan Frederik van Oordt, who was acquainted with them both, suggested that Kruger may have had a hand in this and what followed. In November, when the British authorities in Potchefstroom were about to auction off a burgher's wagon that had been seized amid a tax dispute, Cronj\u00e9 and a group of armed Boers intervened, overcame the presiding officers and reclaimed the wagon. On hearing of this from Cronj\u00e9, Kruger told Joubert: \"I can no longer restrain the people, and the English government is entirely responsible for the present state of things.\" Starting on 8 December 1880 at Paardekraal, a farm to the south-west of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated\u2014the largest recorded meeting of white people in South Africa up to that time. \"I stand here before you\", Kruger declared, \"called by the people. In the voice of the people I have heard the voice of God, the King of Nations, and I obey!\" He announced the fulfilment of the decision taken at Wonderfontein the previous year to restore the South African Republic government and volksraad, which as the vice-president of the last independent administration he considered his####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### responsibility. To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive triumvirate along with Kruger. The assembly approved a proclamation announcing the restoration of the South African Republic.</s><s>Triumvirate.</s><s>Triumvirate.:Transvaal rebellion: the First Boer War. At Kruger's suggestion Joubert was elected Commandant-General of the restored republic, though he had little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at Heidelberg, a strategically placed town on the main road from Natal, and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he surrender the government offices in Pretoria. Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison. Kruger took part in the First Boer War in a civilian capacity only, playing a diplomatic and political role with the aid of Jorissen and Bok. The first major clash, a successful Boer ambush, took place on 20 December 1880 at Bronkhorstspruit. By the turn of the year the Transvaal####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ers had all six British garrison outposts, including that in Pretoria, under siege. Colley assembled a field force in Natal, summoned reinforcements from India, and advanced towards the Transvaal. Joubert moved about 2,000 Boers south to the Drakensberg and repulsed Colley at Laing's Nek on 28 January 1881. After Colley retreated to Schuinshoogte, near Ingogo, he was attacked by Joubert's second-in-command Nicolaas Smit on 8 February and again defeated. Understanding that they could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a solution at the earliest opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world. Colley's death horrified Kruger, who feared it might jeopardise the peace process. His reply to Colley's letter was delivered to his successor Sir Evelyn Wood on 7 March 1881, a day after Wood and Joubert had agreed to an eight-day truce. Kruger was outraged to learn of this armistice, which in his view only gave the British opportunity to strengthen their forces\u2014he expected a British attempt to avenge Majuba, which indeed Wood and others wanted\u2014but Gladstone wanted peace, and Wood was instructed to proceed with talks. Negotiations began on 16 March. The British offered amnesty for the Boer leaders, retrocession of the Transvaal under British suzerainty, a British resident in Pretoria and British control over foreign affairs. Kruger pressed on how the British intended to withdraw and what exactly \"suzerainty\" meant. Brand arrived to mediate on 20 March and the following day agreement was reached; the British committed to formally restore the republic within six months. The final treaty was concluded on 23 March 1881.</s><s>Triumvir####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ate.:Pretoria Convention. Kruger presented the treaty to the volksraad on the triumvirate's behalf at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881. \"With a feeling of gratitude to the God of our fathers\", he said, \"who has been near us in battle and danger, it is to me an unspeakable privilege to lay before you the treaty\u00a0... I consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and the whole world, that our respect for Her Majesty the, for the government of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been greater than at this time, when we are enabled to show you a proof of England's noble and magnanimous love for right and justice.\" This statement was to be ignored by many writers, but Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger's biographers, stresses it as one of his \"most notable utterances\". Kruger reaffirmed his faith in the royal commission of Wood, Sir Hercules Robinson and the Cape's Chief Justice Sir Henry de Villiers, who convened for the first time in Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as an adviser. The commissioners held numerous sessions in Pretoria over the following months with little input from Kruger, who was bedridden with pneumonia.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Kruger was largely happy with the terms under which the republic would regain its sovereignty, but two points offended him. The first of these was that the British would recognise them as the \"Transvaal Republic\" and not the South African Republic; the second was that it was still not clear to him what British \"suzerainty\" was. The commission, in which De Villiers emerged as the dominant figure, defined it primarily as British purview over the Transvaal's external affairs. The final Pretoria Convention was signed on 3 August 1881 by Joubert, Pretorius and the members of the royal commission. Kruger was absent due to his illness, but he did attend the official retrocession five days later in Church Square. Kruger felt well enough to give only a short speech, after which Pretorius addressed the crowd and the \"vierkleur\" was raised. By now aged nearly 56, Kruger resolved that he could no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884. A direct consequence of the end of British rule was an economic slump; the Transvaal government almost immediately found itself again on the verge of bankruptcy. The triumvirate spent two months discussing the terms of the Pretoria Convention with the new volksraad\u2014approve it or go back to Laing's Nek, said Kruger\u2014before it was finally ratified on 25 October 1881. During this time Kruger introduced tax reforms, announced the triumvirate's decision to grant industrial monopolies to raise money and appointed the Reverend S\u00a0J du Toit to be Superintendent of Education. To counteract the influx of uitlanders, the residency qualification to vote was raised from a year to five years. In July 1882 the volksraad decided to elect a new president the following year; Joubert and Kruger emerged as candidates. Kruger campaigned on the idea of an administration in which \"God's Word would be my rule of conduct\"\u2014as premier he would prioritise agriculture, industry and education, revive Burgers's Delagoa Bay railway scheme####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, introduce an immigration policy that would \"prevent the Boer nationality from being stifled\", and pursue a cordial stance towards Britain and \"obedient native races in their appointed districts\". He defeated Joubert by 3,431 votes to 1,171, and was inaugurated as president on 9 May 1883.</s><s>President.</s><s>President.:Third deputation; London Convention. Kruger became president soon after the discovery of gold near what was to become Barberton, which prompted a fresh influx of uitlander diggers. \"This gold is still going to soak our country in blood\", said Joubert\u2014a prediction he would repeat many times over the coming years. Joubert remained commandant-general under Kruger and also became vice-president. A convoluted situation developed on the Transvaal's western frontier, where burghers had crossed the border defined in the Pretoria Convention and formed two new Boer republics, Stellaland and Goshen, on former Tswana territory in 1882. These states were tiny but they occupied land of potentially huge importance\u2014the main road from the Cape to Matabeleland and the African interior. Kruger and the volksraad resolved to send yet another deputation to London to renegoti####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ate the Pretoria Convention and settle the western border issue. The third deputation, comprising Kruger, Smit and Du Toit with Ewald Esselen as secretary, left the Transvaal in August 1883 and sailed from Cape Town two months later. Kruger spent part of the voyage to Britain studying the English language with a Bible printed in Dutch and English side by side. Talks with the new Colonial Secretary Lord Derby and Robinson progressed smoothly\u2014apart from an incident when Kruger, thinking himself insulted, nearly punched Robinson\u2014and on 27 February 1884 the London Convention, superseding that of Pretoria, was concluded. Britain ended its suzerainty, reduced the Transvaal's national debt and once again recognised the country as the South African Republic. The western border question remained unresolved, but Kruger still considered the convention a triumph. The deputation went on from London to mainland Europe, where according to Meintjes their reception \"was beyond all expectations\u00a0... one banquet followed the other, the stand of a handful of Boers against the British Empire having caused a sensation\". During a grand tour Kruger met William III of the Netherlands and his son the Prince of Orange, Leopold II of Belgium, President Jules Gr\u00e9####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####vy of France, Alfonso XII of Spain, Lu\u00eds I of Portugal, and in Germany Kaiser Wilhelm I and his Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. His public appearances were attended by tens of thousands. The deputation discussed the bilateral aspects of the proposed Delagoa Bay railway with the Portuguese, and in the Netherlands laid the groundwork for the Netherlands-South African Railway Company, which would build and operate it. Kruger now held that Burgers had been \"far ahead of his time\"\u2014while reviving his predecessor's railway scheme, he also brought back the policy of importing officials from the Netherlands, in his view a means to strengthen the Boer identity and keep the Transvaal \"Dutch\". Willem Johannes Leyds, a 24-year-old Dutchman, returned to South Africa with the deputation as the republic's new State Attorney. By late 1884 the Scramble for Africa was well underway. Competition on the western frontier rose after Germany annexed South-West Africa; at the behest of the mining magnate and Cape MP Cecil Rhodes, Britain proclaimed a protectorate over Bechuanaland, including the Stellaland\u2013Goshen corridor. While Joubert was in negotiations with Rhodes, Du Toit had Kruger proclaim####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Transvaal protection over the corridor on 18 September 1884. Joubert was outraged, as was Kruger when on 3 October Du Toit unilaterally hoisted the \"vierkleur\" in Goshen. Realising the implications of this\u2014it clearly violated the London Convention\u2014Kruger had the flag stricken immediately and retracted his proclamation of 18 September. Meeting Rhodes personally in late January 1885, Kruger insisted the \"flag incident\" had taken place without his consent and conceded the corridor to the British.</s><s>President.:Gold rush; burghers and uitlanders. In July 1886 an Australian prospector reported to the Transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between Pretoria and Heidelberg. The South African Republic's formal proclamation of this two months later prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg, which within a few years was the largest city in southern Africa, populated almost entirely by uitlanders. The economic landscape of the region was transformed overnight\u2014the South African Republic went from the verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony's the following year. The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority. The President was by this time widely nicknamed \"Oom Paul\" (\"Uncle Paul\"), both among the Boers and the uitlanders, who variously used it out of affection or contempt. He was perceived by some as a despot after he compromised the independence of the republic's judiciary to help his friend Alois Hugo Nellmapius, who had been found guilty of embezzlement\u2014Kruger rejected the court's judgement and granted Nellmapius a full pardon, an act Nathan calls \"completely indefensible\". Kruger defeated Joubert again in the 1888 election, by 4,483 votes to 834, and was sworn in for a second time in May. Nicolaas Smit was elected vice-president, and Leyds was promoted to state secretary. Much of Kruger's efforts over the next year were dedicated to attempts to acquire a sea outlet for the South African Republic. In July Pieter Grobler, who had just negotiated a treaty with King Lobengula of Matabeleland, was killed by Ngwato warriors on his way home; Kruger alleged that this was the work of \"Cecil Rhodes and his clique####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\". Kruger despised Rhodes, considering him corrupt and immoral\u2014in his memoirs he called him \"capital incarnate\" and \"the curse of South Africa\". According to the editor of Kruger's memoirs, Rhodes attempted to win him as an ally by suggesting \"we simply take\" Delagoa Bay from Portugal; Kruger was appalled. Failing to make headway in talks with the Portuguese, Kruger switched his attention to Kosi Bay, next to Swaziland, in late 1888. In early 1889 Kruger and the new Orange Free State President Francis William Reitz enacted a common-defence pact and a customs treaty waiving most import duties. The same year the volksraad passed constitutional revisions to remove the \"Nederduits Hervormde Kerk\"'s official status, open the legislature to members of other denominations and make all churches \"sovereign in their own spheres\". Kruger proposed to end the lack of higher education in the Boer republics by forming a university in Pretoria; enthusiastic support emerged for this but the Free University of Amsterdam expressed strong opposition, not wishing to lose the Afrikaner element of its student body. No university was built. Kruger was obsessed with the South African Republic's independence####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, the retention of which he perceived as under threat if the Transvaal became too British in character. The uitlanders created an acute predicament in his mind. Taxation on their mining provided almost all of the republic's revenues, but they had very limited civic representation and almost no say in the running of the country. Though the English language was dominant in the mining areas, only Dutch remained official. Kruger expressed great satisfaction at the new arrivals' industry and respect for the state's laws, but surmised that giving them full burgher rights might cause the Boers to be swamped by sheer weight in numbers, with the probable result of absorption into the British sphere. Agonising over how he \"could meet the wishes of the new population for representation, without injuring the republic or prejudicing the interests of the older burghers\", he thought he had solved the problem in 1889 when he tabled a \"second volksraad\" in which the uitlanders would have certain matters devolved to them. Most deemed this inadequate, and even Kruger's own supporters were unenthusiastic. Rhodes and other British figures often contended that there were more uitlanders in the Transvaal than Boers. Kruger's administration recorded twice as many####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Transvaalers as uitlanders, but acknowledged that there were more uitlanders than enfranchised burghers. According to the British Liberal politician James Bryce, most uitlanders saw the country as \"virtually English\" and perceived \"something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors\". On 4 March 1890, when Kruger visited Johannesburg, men sang British patriotic songs, tore down and trampled on the \"vierkleur\" at the city landdrost's office, and rioted outside the house where the President was staying. One of the agitators accused him of treating the uitlanders with contempt; Kruger retorted: \"I have no contempt for the new population, only for people like yourself.\" The riot was broken up by police and the Chamber of Mines issued an apology, which Kruger accepted, saying only a few of the uitlanders had taken part. Few Boers were as conciliatory as Kruger; Meintjes marks this as \"the point where the rift between the Transvaalers and the uitlanders began\".</s><s>President.:Early 1890s. In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### High Commissioner and Governor Sir Henry Brougham Loch, Loch's legal adviser William Philip Schreiner, and Rhodes, who had by now attained a dominant position in the Transvaal's mining industry and a royal charter for his British South Africa Company to occupy and administer Matabeleland and Mashonaland. A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland\u2014the so-called Bowler Trek\u2014and Rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans. He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and pledge not to expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, thinking this union might easily turn into the federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland. Rhodes became prime minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A month later the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without consulting the Swazis)\u2014the South African Republic could build a railway through it to Kosi Bay on the condition that the Transvaal thereafter supported####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the interests of Rhodes's Chartered Company in Matabeleland and its environs. Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of the economy and the civil service\u2014now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports\u2014caused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and price gouging. Kruger's second volksraad sat for the first time in 1891. Any resolution it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years' residency on the condition they were naturalised as burghers\u2014a process requiring the renunciation of any foreign allegiance. The residency qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### they had to be at least 40 years old. During the close-run campaign for the 1893 election, in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice John Gilbert Kotz\u00e9 as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year residency requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state's independence. The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotz\u00e9. Joubert's supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and although the results varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893. Kruger was by this time widely perceived as a personification of Afrikanerdom both at home and abroad. When he stopped going to the government offices at the Raadsaal by foot and began to be conveyed there by a presidential carriage, his coming and going became a public spectacle not unlike the Changing of the Guard in Britain. \"Once seen, he is not easily forgotten\", wrote Lady Phillips. \"His greasy frock coat and antiquated tall hat have been portrayed####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### times without number\u00a0... and I think his character is clearly to be read in his face\u2014strength of character and cunning.\"</s><s>President.:Rising tensions: raiders and reformers. By 1894 the Kosi Bay scheme had been abandoned and the Delagoa Bay line was almost complete, and the railways from Natal and the Cape had reached Johannesburg. Chief Malaboch's insurgency in the north compelled Joubert to call up a commando and the State Artillery in May 1894. Those drafted included British subjects, the large majority of whom indignantly refused to report, feeling that as foreigners they should be exempted. Kotz\u00e9's ruling that British nationality did not preclude one from conscription as a Transvaal resident prompted an outpouring of displeasure from the uitlanders that manifested itself when Loch visited Pretoria the following month. Protesters waited for Kruger and Loch to enter the presidential coach at the railway station, then unharnessed the horses, attached a Union Jack and raucously dragged the carriage to Loch's hotel. Embarrassed, Loch complied with Kruger's request that he should not go on to Johannesburg. Kruger announced that \"the government will, in the meantime, provisionally, no more commandeer British####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### subjects for personal military service\". In his memoirs, he alleged that Loch secretly conferred with the uitlanders' National Union at this time about how long the miners could hold Johannesburg by arms without British help. The following year the National Union sent Kruger a petition bearing 38,500 signatures requesting electoral reform. Kruger dismissed all such entreaties with the assertion that enfranchising \"these new-comers, these disobedient persons\" might imperil the republic's independence. \"Protest!\" he shouted at one uitlander deputation; \"What is the use of protesting? I have the guns, you haven't.\" The Johannesburg press became intensely hostile to the President personally, using the term \"Krugerism\" to encapsulate all the republic's perceived injustices. In August 1895, after gauging burghers' views from across the country, the first volksraad rejected the opposition's bill to give all uitlanders the vote by 14 ballots to 10. Kruger said this did not extend to those who had \"proved their trustworthiness\", and conferred burgher rights on all uitlanders who had served in Transvaal commandos. The Delagoa Bay railway line was completed in December 1894\u2014the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### realisation of a great personal ambition for Kruger, who tightened the final bolt of \"our national railway\" personally. The formal opening in July 1895 was a gala affair with leading figures from all the neighbouring territories present, including Loch's successor Sir Hercules Robinson. \"This railway changed the whole internal situation in the Transvaal\", Kruger wrote in his autobiography. \"Until that time, the Cape railway had enjoyed a monopoly, so to speak, of the Johannesburg traffic.\" Difference of opinion between Kruger and Rhodes over the distribution of the profits from customs duties led to the Drifts Crisis of September\u2013October 1895: the Cape Colony avoided the Transvaal railway fees by using wagons instead. Kruger's closure of the drifts (fords) in the Vaal River where the wagons crossed prompted Rhodes to call for support from Britain on the grounds that the London Convention was being breached. The Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain told Kruger if he did not reopen the drifts Britain would do so by force; Kruger backed down. Understanding that renewed hostilities with Britain were now a real possibility, Kruger began to pursue armament. Relations with Germany had been warming for some time; when Leyds went there for medical treatment in late 1895, he took####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### with him an order from the Transvaal government for rifles and munitions. Conferring with the Colonial Office, Rhodes pondered the co-ordination of an uitlander revolt in Johannesburg with British military intervention, and had a force of about 500 marshalled on the Bechuanaland\u2013Transvaal frontier under Leander Starr Jameson, the Chartered Company's administrator in Matabeleland. On 29 December 1895, ostensibly following an urgent plea from the Johannesburg Reform Committee (as the National Union now called itself), these troops crossed the border and rode for the Witwatersrand\u2014the Jameson Raid had begun. Jameson's force failed to cut all of the telegraph wires, allowing a rural Transvaal official to raise the alarm early, though there are suggestions Kruger had been tipped off some days before. Joubert called up the burghers and rode west to meet Jameson. Robinson publicly repudiated Jameson's actions and ordered him back, but Jameson ignored him and pushed on towards Johannesburg; Robinson wired Kruger offering to come immediately for talks. The Reform Committee's efforts to rally the uitlanders for revolt floundered, partly because not all of the mine-owners (or \"Randlords\") were supportive####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, and by 31 December the conspirators had raised a makeshift \"vierkleur\" over their headquarters at the offices of Rhodes's Gold Fields company, signalling their capitulation. Unaware of this, Jameson continued until he was forced to surrender to Piet Cronj\u00e9 on 2 January 1896. A congratulatory telegram to Kruger from Kaiser Wilhelm II on 3 January prompted a storm of anti-Boer and anti-German feeling in Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result. Kruger shouted down talk of the death penalty for the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson's proposed mediation with alacrity. After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British custody and granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason. The four main leaders\u2014Lionel Phillips, John Hays Hammond, George Farrar and Frank Rhodes (brother of Cecil)\u2014pleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of \u00a325,000 each.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####</s><s>President.:Resurgence. The Jameson Raid ruined Rhodes's political reputation in the Cape and lost him his longstanding support from the Afrikaner Bond; he resigned as prime minister of the Cape Colony on 12 January. Kruger's handling of the affair made his name a household word across the world and won him much support from Afrikaners in the Cape and the Orange Free State, who began to visit Pretoria in large numbers. The President granted personal audiences to travellers and writers such as Olive Schreiner and Frank Harris, and wore the knightly orders of the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and France on his sash of state. Jameson was jailed by the British but released after four months. The republic made armament one of its main priorities, ordering huge quantities of rifles, munitions, field guns and howitzers, primarily from Germany and France. In March 1896 Marthinus Theunis Steyn, the young lawyer Kruger had encountered on the ship to England two decades earlier, became President of the Orange Free State. They quickly won each other's confidence; each man's memoirs would describe the other in glowing terms. Chamberlain began to take exception to the South African Republic's diplomatic actions, such as joining the Geneva Convention,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### which he said breached Article IV of the London Convention (which forbade extraterritorial dealings except \"vis-a-vis\" the Orange Free State). Chamberlain asserted that the Transvaal was still under British suzerainty, a claim Kruger called \"nonsensical\". Kruger and Steyn concluded a treaty of trade and friendship in Bloemfontein in March 1897, along with a fresh military alliance binding each republic to defend the other's independence. Two months later Sir Alfred Milner became the new high commissioner and governor in Cape Town. Kruger developed a habit of threatening to resign whenever the volksraad did not give him his way. In the 1897 session there was much surprise when the new member Louis Botha reacted to the usual proffered resignation by leaping up and moving to accept it. A constitutional crisis developed after the judiciary under Chief Justice Kotz\u00e9 abandoned its prior stance of giving volksraad resolutions legal precedence over the constitution. \"This decision would have upset the whole country\", Kruger recalled, \"for a number of rules concerning the goldfields, the franchise and so on depended on resolutions of the volksraad.\" Chief Justice De Villiers of the Cape mediated, sided with Kruger and upheld the vol####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ksraad decrees. Kruger was never more popular domestically than during the 1897\u201398 election campaign, and indeed was widely perceived to be jollier than he had been in years. He won his most decisive election victory yet\u201412,853 votes to Joubert's 2,001 and Schalk Willem Burger's 3,753\u2014and was sworn in as president for the fourth time on 12 May 1898. After a three-hour inauguration address, his longest speech as president, his first act of his fourth term was to sack Kotz\u00e9, who was still claiming the right to test legislation in the courts. To Kruger's critics this lent much credence to the notion that he was a tyrant. Milner called Kotz\u00e9's dismissal \"the end of real justice in the Transvaal\" and a step that \"threatened all British subjects and interests there\". Kruger's final administration was, Meintjes suggests, the strongest in the history of the republic. He had the former Free State President F\u00a0W Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in Brussels, as Envoy Extraordinary in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to a young lawyer from the Cape called####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Jan Smuts, for whom Kruger presaged great things. The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger's longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners' sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them from this point on.</s><s>President.:Road to war. Anglo-German relations warmed during late 1898, with Berlin disavowing any interest in the Transvaal; this opened the way for Milner and Chamberlain to take a firmer line against Kruger. The so-called \"Edgar case\" of early 1899, in which a South African Republic Policeman was acquitted of manslaughter after shooting a British subject dead during an attempted arrest, prompted outcry from the British element in the Transvaal and is highlighted by Nathan as \"the starting point of the final agitation which led to war\". The South African League, a new uitlander movement, prepared two petitions, each with more than 20,000 signatures, that appealed to Queen Victoria for intervention against the Transvaal government, which they called inefficient, corrupt and oppressive. Other uitlanders produced a counter-petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with Kruger's government. Attempting to address the main point of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### contention raised by Milner and Chamberlain, Kruger spoke of reducing the residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less. In May and June 1899 he and Milner met in Bloemfontein, with Steyn taking on the role of mediator. \"You \"must\" make concessions on the franchise issue\", Steyn counselled. \"Franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with the first principles of a republican and democratic government. The Free State expects you to concede\u00a0... Should you not give in on this issue, you will lose all sympathy and all your friends.\" Kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower the franchise and was \"prepared to do anything\"\u2014\"but they must not touch my independence\", he said. \"They must be reasonable in their demands.\" Milner wanted full voting rights after five years' residence, a revised naturalisation oath and increased legislative representation for the new burghers. Kruger offered naturalisation after two years' residence and full franchise after five more (seven years, effectively) along with increased representation and a new oath similar to that of the Free State. The High Commissioner declared his original request an \"irreducible minimum\" and said he would discuss nothing else until####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the franchise question was resolved. On 5 June Milner proposed an advisory council of non-burghers to represent the uitlanders, prompting Kruger to cry: \"How can strangers rule my state? How is it possible!\" When Milner said he did not foresee this council taking on any governing role, Kruger burst into tears, saying \"It is our country you want\". Milner ended the conference that evening, saying the further meetings Steyn and Kruger wanted were unnecessary. Back in Pretoria Kruger introduced a draft law to give the mining regions four more seats in each volksraad and fix a seven-year residency period for voting rights. This would not be retroactive, but up to two years' prior residence would be counted towards the seven, and uitlanders already in the country for nine years or more would get the vote immediately. Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr of the Afrikaner Bond persuaded Kruger to make this fully retrospective (to immediately enfranchise all white men in the country seven years or more), but Milner and the South African League deemed this insufficient. After Kruger rejected the British proposal of a joint commission on the franchise law, Smuts and Reitz proposed a five-year retroactive franchise and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the extension of a quarter of the volksraad seats to the Witwatersrand region, on the condition that Britain drop any claim to suzerainty. Chamberlain issued an ultimatum in September 1899 in which he insisted on five years without conditions, else the British would \"formulate their own proposals for a final settlement\". Kruger resolved that war was inevitable, comparing the Boers' position to that of a man attacked by a lion with only a pocketknife for defence. \"Would you be such a coward as not to defend yourself with your pocketknife?\" he posited. Aware of the deployment of British troops from elsewhere in the Empire, Kruger and Smuts surmised that from a military standpoint the Boers' only chance was a swift pre-emptive strike. Steyn was anxious that they not be seen as the aggressors and insisted they delay until there was absolutely no hope of peace. He informed Kruger on 9 October that he also now thought war unavoidable; that afternoon the Transvaal government handed the British envoy Conyngham Greene an ultimatum advising that if Britain did not withdraw all troops from the border within 48 hours, a state of war would exist. The British government considered the conditions impossible and informed Kruger of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### this on 11 October 1899. The start of the Second Boer War was announced in Pretoria that day, at 17:00 local time.</s><s>President.:Second Boer War. The outbreak of war raised Kruger's international profile even further. In countries antagonistic to Britain he was idolised; Kruger expressed high hopes of German, French or Russian military intervention, despite the repeated despatches from Leyds telling him this was a fantasy. Kruger took no part in the fighting, partly because of his age and poor health\u2014he turned 74 the week war broke out\u2014but perhaps primarily to prevent his being killed or captured. His personal contributions to the military campaign were mostly from his office in Pretoria, where he oversaw the war effort and advised his officers by telegram. The Boer commandos, including four of Kruger's sons, six sons-in-law and 33 of his grandsons, advanced quickly into the Cape and Natal, won a series of victories and by the end of October were besieging Kimberley, Ladysmith and Mafeking. Soon thereafter, following a serious injury to Joubert, Kruger appointed Louis Botha to be acting commandant-general. The British relief of Kimberley and Lad####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ysmith in February 1900 marked the turning of the war against the Boers. Morale plummeted among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, along with a few thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later. With the major towns and the railways under British control, the conventional phase of the war ended; Kruger wired Steyn pondering surrender, but the Free State President insisted they fight \"to the bitter end\". Kruger found new strength in Steyn and telegrammed all Transva####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####al officers forbidding the laying down of arms. \"Bittereinders\" (\"bitter-enders\") under Botha, Christiaan de Wet and Koos de la Rey took to the veld and waged a guerrilla campaign. British forces under Lord Kitchener applied a scorched earth policy in response, destroying the farmsteads owned by Boer guerillas still active in the field; non-combatants (mostly women and children) were put into what the British dubbed \"concentration camps\". Kruger moved to Waterval Onder, where his small house became the \"Krugerhof\", in late June. After Roberts announced the annexation of the South African Republic to the British Empire on 1 September 1900\u2014the Free State had been annexed on 24 May\u2014Kruger proclaimed on 3 September that this was \"not recognised\" and \"declared null and void\". It was decided in the following days that to prevent his capture Kruger would leave for Louren\u00e7o Marques and there board ship for Europe. Officially he was to tour the continent, and perhaps America too, to raise support for the Boer cause.</s><s>Exile and death. Kruger left the Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900\u2014he####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### wept as the train crossed into Mozambique. He planned to board the first outgoing steamer, the \"Herzog\" of the German East Africa Line, but was prevented from doing so when, at the behest of the local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under house arrest. About a month later Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands concluded a deal with Britain to extricate Kruger on a Dutch warship, HNLMS \"Gelderland\", and convey him through non-British waters to Marseille. Kruger was delighted to hear of this but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. \"Gelderland\" departed on 20 October 1900. He received a rapturous welcome in Marseille on 22 November\u201460,000 people turned out to see him disembark. Accompanied by Leyds, he went on to an exuberant reception in Paris, then continued to Cologne on 1 December. Here the public greeted him with similar excitement, but Kaiser Wilhelm II refused to receive him in Berlin. Having apparently still harboured hopes of German assistance in the war, Kruger was deeply shocked. \"The Kaiser has betrayed us\", he told####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Leyds. They went on to the Netherlands, which was strictly neutral and could not assist militarily, but would feel more like home. After another buoyant reception from the general public Kruger was cordially received by Wilhelmina and her family in The Hague, but it soon became clear to Leyds that it embarrassed the Dutch authorities to have them staying in the seat of government. The Kruger party moved to Hilversum in April 1901. Gezina, with whom Kruger had had 16 children\u2014nine sons, seven daughters (of whom some died young)\u2014had eight sickly grandchildren transferred to her from the concentration camp at Krugersdorp, where their mother had died, in July 1901. Five of the eight children died within nine days, and two weeks later Gezina also died. Meintjes writes that a \"strange silence\" enveloped Kruger thereafter. By now partially blind and almost totally deaf, he dictated his memoirs to his secretary Hermanus Christiaan \"Madie\" Bredell and Pieter Grobler during the latter part of 1901, and the following year they were published. Kruger and his entourage relocated in December 1901 to Utrecht, where he took a comfortable villa####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### called \"Oranjelust\" and was joined by his daughter Elsje Eloff and her family. Rhodes died in March 1902, bequeathing Groote Schuur to be the official residence for future premiers of a unified South Africa. Kruger quipped to Bredell: \"Perhaps I'll be the first.\" The war formally ended on 31 May 1902 with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging; the Boer republics became the Orange River and Transvaal Colonies. Kruger accepted it was all over only when Bredell had the flags of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State removed from outside Oranjelust two weeks later. In reply to condolences from Germany, Kruger would only say: \"My grief is beyond expression.\" Kruger would not countenance the idea of returning home, partly because of personal reluctance to become a British subject again, and partly because he thought he could better serve his people by remaining in exile. Steyn similarly refused to accept the Boer defeat and joined Kruger in Europe, though he did later return to Southern Africa. Botha, De Wet and De la Rey visited Oranjelust in August 1902 and, according to hearsay, were####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### berated by Kruger for \"signing away independence\"\u2014rumours of such a scene were widespread enough that the generals issued a statement denying them. After passing October 1902 to May 1903 at Menton on the French Riviera, Kruger moved back to Hilversum, then returned to Menton in October 1903. In early 1904 he moved to Clarens, a small village in the canton of Vaud in western Switzerland where he spent the rest of his days looking over Lake Geneva and the Alps from his balcony. \"He who wishes to create a future must not lose track of the past\", he wrote in his final letter, addressed to the people of the Transvaal. \"Thus; seek all that is to be found good and fair in the past, shape your ideal accordingly and try to realise that ideal for the future. It is true: much that has been built is now destroyed, damaged, levelled. But with unity of purpose and unity of strength that which has been pulled down can be built again.\" After contracting pneumonia, Paul Kruger died in Clarens on 14 July 1904 at the age of 78. His Bible lay open on a table beside him. Kruger's body was initially buried in The Hague, but was soon repatriated####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### with British permission. After ceremonial lying in state, he was accorded a state funeral in Pretoria on 16 December 1904, the \"vierkleur\" of the South African Republic draped over his coffin, and buried in what is now called the Heroes' Acre in the Church Street Cemetery.</s><s>Appraisal and legacy. Academic opinion on Kruger is divided. To admirers he was an astute reader of people, events and law who faithfully defended a maligned nation and became a tragic folk hero; to critics he was \"an anachronistic throwback\", the stubborn, slippery guardian of an unjust cause and an oppressor of black Africans. \"More nonsense has been written about him than anybody I know of\", writes Meintjes, in whose view the true figure has been obscured by conflicting attempts to sabotage or whitewash his image\u2014\"a veritable bog of hostility and sentiment, prejudice and deification\", depicting Kruger as anything \"from saint to stuffy mendacious savage\". Rights and wrongs aside, Meintjes asserts, Kruger is the central figure of Boer history and one of the \"most extraordinary\" of South Africans. Following the Union of South Africa under Botha in 1910, Kruger remained \"a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### vital force in South African politics and Afrikaner culture\". The government wildlife reserve he had proclaimed in 1898 was expanded and dubbed Kruger National Park in 1926. In 1954, over half a century after its construction by Anton van Wouw, a bronze statue of Kruger in his characteristic Dopper suit and top hat was erected in Church Square, Pretoria; Kruger stands atop a plinth surrounded by four crouching Boers from different time periods. Thirteen years later the South African Mint put his likeness on the Krugerrand, a gold bullion coin still produced and exported in the 21st century. His home in Pretoria and farm at Boekenhoutfontein are provincial heritage sites, the former of which is preserved to appear as in his time. Kruger gives his name to the town of Krugersdorp, and to many streets and squares in South Africa and other countries, especially the Netherlands and Belgium. This has, on occasion, led to controversy; in 2009 local authorities in St Gallen, Switzerland renamed \"Kr\u00fcgerstrasse\" \"because of racist associations\". Clarens, Free State is named after Kruger's last home in Switzerland. During the Second World War Kruger's life story and image were####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### appropriated by propagandists in Nazi Germany, who produced the biographical film \"Ohm Kr\u00fcger\" (\"Uncle Kr\u00fcger\", 1941) to attack the British, with Emil Jannings in the title role. The underdevelopment of South African administrative law until the late 20th century was, Davenport asserts, the direct result of Kruger's censure and dismissal of Chief Justice Kotz\u00e9 in 1898 over the question of judicial review. \"Paul Kruger's name and fame he made himself\", Leyds said. \"It is sometimes said that he was illiterate. This is of course nonsense\u00a0... He was certainly not learned, but he had a thorough knowledge of many things.\" \"In the lower spheres of diplomacy Mr Kruger was a master\", E\u00a0B Iwan-M\u00fcller asserted. \"He was quick in detecting the false moves made by his opponents, and an adept in turning them to his own advantage; but of the large combinations he was hopelessly incapable. To secure a brilliant and conspicuous success today he was ready to squander the prospects of the future, if, indeed, he had the power of forecasting them.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Beenie Man Moses Anthony Davis (born 22 August 1973), better known by his stage name Beenie Man, is a Jamaican Dancehall deejay.</s><s>Biography. Davis was born in the Waterhouse district of Kingston in 1973. He was involved in the music industry from a young age, started toasting at the age of five, and was encouraged by his uncle Sydney Knowles, who played drums for Jimmy Cliff. He won the Tastee Talent contest in 1981, and Radio DJ Barry G introduced him to local sound system operators, who helped to establish the popularity of the young deejay, who became known as Beenie Man. He recorded his debut single, \"Too Fancy\", with record producer Henry \"Junjo\" Lawes in 1981, with Lawes also including him on the 1983 album \"Junjo Presents Two Big Sounds\" alongside established stars such as Dillinger, Fathead, and Ringo. His debut album, \"The Invincible Beenie Man: The Ten Year Old DJ Wonder\" was produced by Bunny Lee and released in 1983, his first hit single following the same year with the Winston Holness-produced \"Over the Sea\". In 1984 Beenie Man recorded some material with Barrington Levy (released ten years####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### later), but his music career was put on hold while he finished school, and spent time travelling to the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada.</s><s>Biography.:1990s return. Beenie Man continued performing and honed his craft beside the then dominant Dancehall figures including Ninjaman, Admiral Bailey and Shabba Ranks. He found his artistic home at the Shocking Vibes studio where he continued to record singles with only moderate success in the early 1990s. His career gained momentum after a performance at the Reggae Sunsplash festival in 1992, and a rivalry with Bounty Killer began the following year after Beenie Man was accused of stealing Bounty Killer's style and catch phrases. The rivalry was captured on the 1994 album \"Guns Out\", with the two artists settling the feud with a soundclash. Beenie Man had his first number one single in Jamaica in 1993 with \"Matie\" (Produced by Ephraim Barrett, Donovan and Dave Mills on the Shelly Power Records label) and he won the DJ of the Year Award the same year, the first of eight consecutive awards.</s><s>Biography.:International stardom. Partially as a result of prodding from his producers, Sly and Robbie, with####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### whom he recorded cover versions of Bob Marley's \"Crazy Baldhead\" and \"No Woman No Cry\" in 1994, the latter a Jamaican chart-topper, Beenie Man converted to the Rastafari movement, as did several of his contemporaries at the time, although in 2005 he stated \"I have not converted. I was baptised an Ethiopian Orthodox and at the age of 10 I became a Judah Coptic.\" In 1994, he was signed by Island Records and released the critically acclaimed album \"Blessed\", which established his reputation internationally. In 1995 he toured the UK and joined up again with Barrington Levy to record an updated jungle version of Levy's \"Under Mi Sensi\". In 1995, Beenie Man collaborated with Dennis Brown and Triston Palma to release \"Three Against War\" and Mad Cobra and Lieutenant Stitchie on \"Mad Cobra Meets Lt. Stitchie & Beenie Man\". He also collaborated with Lady Saw on \"Healing\", Sanchez on \"Refugee\", and Michael Prophet on \"Gun 'n' Bass\", further establishing his reputation. He took another step up the ladder in 1996, releasing the seminal \"Maestro\", produced by Patrick Roberts and shot him to UK fame. During the period from the mid####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to late 1990s, Beenie Man dominated the Jamaican charts to the extent that he perhaps had a good claim to the crown of \"Dancehall King\", a title only bestowed previously on Yellowman in the early 1980s. Beenie Man's first real break into the United States came in 1997. He heard an instrumental rhythm by an unknown producer named Jeremy Harding, and demanded to add his voice to the rhythm. So this was the birth of his first international hit; he recorded \"Who Am I\" and the single quickly went Gold. It opened the doors for the world to see a new reggae star in the pages of Newsweek and other major media outlets. The same year, Beenie Man topped the Jamaican singles chart with seven different singles. Beenie Man appeared as himself in the 1997 film \"Dancehall Queen\". In 1998, Beenie Man headlined Reggae Sunsplash and signed to Virgin Records to release albums in the United States. His first American offering was \"The Doctor\" (1998). During the late 1990s, Beenie Man began his conquest of America with the hits, \"Romie\", \"Who Am I\", and \"Girls Dem Sugar\", which featured American R&B singer, M\u00fda. During this time####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### he received an impressive number of international music awards including a MOBO Award for Best International Reggae Act in 1998, while remaining at the top of the local charts. In 2000, Beenie Man released \"Art & Life\", which featured Arturo Sandoval and Wyclef Jean (The Fugees), for which received a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. In the same year he co-produced (with Wyclef Jean) the debut album by actor Steven Seagal. Beenie Man, like many dancehall artists, is outspoken on a number of social issues, as exemplified by songs such as \"Steve Biko\" and \"Murderer\". In 2002, he had a sizeable hit with a duet with Janet Jackson called \"Feel It Boy\", but his biggest break in America came in early 2004 with the release of a remix of \"Dude\", featuring guest vocals by fellow Jamaican Ms. Thing as well as rhymes by Shawnna. He thus cemented his fan base on both sides of the Atlantic. He had hits in the UK in 1998 with \"Who am I\" (#10), in 2003 with \"Street Life\" (#13) and \"Feel It Boy\" (UK #9), a duet with Janet####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Jackson, and in 2004 with \"Dude\" (#7) and \"King of the Dancehall\" (#14). Also in 2004, The Associated Press observed that Beenie Man had \"become a name-brand artist worldwide\" and called him \"king of the dancehall reggae scene\". He was also a judge for the 6th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. In April 2008, it was announced that Beenie Man was to co-write and star in the film \"Kingston\". In October 2010, Beenie Man came out with the EP \"I'm Drinking Rum and Red Bull\", which included four songs, \"Im drinking Rum and Red Bull\", \"I'm Okay\", and two versions of \"Stack and Pile\". He later released the full album on 28 February 2011. \"Im Drinking Rum and Red Bull\" features Future Fambo. In September 2008, Beenie Man was cleared of charges of tax evasion. In April 2009, Beenie Man signed with Brookland Entertainment, a new record label formed by Eric Nicks and The Trackmasters, in preparation to release his new album \"The Legend Returns\", the music video for the release of his new single \"Gimme Gimme\" being shot in Canada on 18 April####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 2009. The song \"Let's Go\" was released on the \"Overproof Riddim\" compilation album in 2011. In 2014, Beenie Man and long-term rival Bounty Killer put aside their differences and recorded a single together, \"Legendary\". The two performed a well-received Verzuz battle together on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine on 23 May 2020. Around that time, Vibe described them as \"two of the most legendary icons in dancehall.\"</s><s>Personal life. Beenie Man married Michelle \"D'Angel\" Downer on 22 August 2006. In June 2007, Beenie Man separated from his wife. In March 2010, they released a duet single entitled \"You Are My First\", although at the time they were separated. The couple divorced in 2011.</s><s>Controversy.</s><s>Controversy.:Anti-gay lyrics. The lyrics to some of his songs have been criticised for inciting the murder of homosexuals. He was removed from the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards after protests by gay-rights activists. That same year, Beenie Man was stopped by police at Heathrow Airport in London, after the cancellation of a concert in the United Kingdom. He then issued an apology for the lyrics through his record####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### company. In 2005, gay rights group OutRage! suspended their opposition to Beenie Man after he agreed not to play songs featuring homophobic lyrics, and he performed in London that year. The following year, he claimed his lyrics were anti-paedophilia, not against consensual homosexual relationships. In 2007, it was reported that Beenie Man, along with several other artists, had signed the Reggae Compassionate Act, an agreement to cease performances of anti-gay material. He later denied that he had signed the act. As of 2010, protests have continued to cause cancellations of his concerts in some countries, including New Zealand, Belgium and the Netherlands. In 2012, Beenie Man apologized to the gay community for his earlier homophobic lyrics: \"Let me make this clear and straight. I have nothing against no one. I respect each and every human being, regardless of which race or creed, regardless of which religious belief you believe in, and regardless of which sexual preference you are, including gays and lesbian people. I respect all human...Please I am begging you do not have me up for some songs I wrote a long time ago. I love each and every one and am just begging each and everyone to do the same.\" In other interviews, however####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, he was quoted making statements such as \"I never apologized\" and \"I told them to leave us alone, to try to understand where we are coming from.\" In 2015 prior to coming to New Zealand for a concert, GayNZ.com news site asked Beenie Man about the homophobic lyrics in his earlier songs. He hung up the telephone without answering.</s><s>Controversy.:Yellowman feud. In 2006, veteran deejay Yellowman publicly chastised Beenie Man for his hit \"King of the Dancehall\". Known as \"King Yellowman\" since the 1980s, the deejay took exception to Beenie Man proclaiming himself \"king\", as well as comments Beenie made regarding his appearance. Regarding the title of \"king\", Yellowman stated: \"Him trying to make people feel like him was here before me, but him never deh here before me, because dem planning to do dem official crowning them claim say is an official crowning but dem a use some a di media as some of them organisation...\". Beenie Man made comments later that year in German-based Riddim Magazine, comparing Bounty Killer to Yellowman in appearance: \"Bounty Killer is a great artiste and he's ugly, too. He's####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### got a rough thing about him, Jamaicans like that from the Shabba Rankin' days and the King Stitt days and the Yellowman days. They like ugly people.\" Yellowman responded, \"Him can diss me all him like, but him caan diss the Jamaican public. What kinda ting that him say inna \"Riddim\" magazine? If me ugly, him pretty, me know say me wear shirt, him wear blouse, me wear pants, him wear skirt.\"</s><s>Legal issues.</s><s>Legal issues.:Court case.

After his early death, he was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973, becoming both the first Caribbean and the first Latin-American player to be enshrined. Because he died at a young age and had such a historic career, the Hall of Fame changed its rules of eligibility. As an alternative to a player having to be retired for five years before eligibility, a player who has been deceased for at least six months is eligible for entry. Clemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games. He was the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1966, the NL batting leader in 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and a Gold Glove Award winner for 12 consecutive seasons from 1961 through 1972. His batting average was over.300 for 13 seasons and he had 3,000 hits during his major league career. He also was a two-time World Series champion. Clemente was the first player from the Caribbean and Latin America####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to win a World Series as a starting position player (1960), to receive an NL MVP Award (1966), and to receive a World Series MVP Award (1971).

In 1972, he died in a plane crash at the age of 38 while en route to deliver aid to victims of the Nicaragua earthquake. The following season, the Pirates retired his uniform number 21, and MLB renamed its annual Commissioner's Award in his honor. Now known as the Roberto Clemente Award, it is given to the player who \"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team.\"</s><s>Early life. Roberto was born in Barrio San Ant\u00f3n, Carolina, Puerto Rico, to Melchor Clemente and Luisa Walker. He was the youngest of seven children. During Clemente's childhood, his father worked as a foreman for sugar cane crops located in the municipality, located in the northeastern part of the island. Because the family's resources were limited, Clemente and his brothers worked alongside his father in the fields, loading and unloading trucks. As a youth,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Clemente was a track and field star and Olympic hopeful before deciding to turn his attention to baseball. Clemente had first shown interest in baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios. He attended Julio Vizcarrondo Coronado High School in Carolina. During his first year in high school, he was recruited by Roberto Mar\u00edn to play softball with the Sello Rojo team after he was seen playing baseball in barrio San Ant\u00f3n. He was with the team two years as a shortstop. Clemente joined Puerto Rico's amateur league when he was 16 years old, playing for the Ferdinand Juncos team, which represented the municipality of Juncos.</s><s>Puerto Rican baseball (1952\u20131954). Clemente's professional baseball career began at age 18 when he accepted a contract from Pedr\u00edn Zorilla with Cangrejeros de Santurce (\"Crabbers\"), a winter league team and franchise of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League (LBPPR). Clemente signed with the team on October 9, 1952. He was a bench player during his first season but was promoted to the Cangrejeros' starting lineup the following season. During this season he hit.288 as the team's leadoff####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### hitter. While Clemente was playing in the LBPPR, the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract with one of the team's Triple-A affiliates.</s><s>Minor league baseball (1954). After signing with the Dodgers on February 19, 1954, Clemente moved to Montreal to play with the Royals. Affected early on by both climate and language differences, Clemente received assistance from bilingual teammates such as infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black. Black was the original target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' June 1, 1954, scouting trip to Richmond.McGowan, Lloyd. \"Macon's Royals Register: Top Richmond A la Grant \u2013 Amoros Hits\". \"The Montreal Star\". June 2, 1954. \"Clyde Sukeforth, once a Royal General, said the Amoros homer came off a high fastball.... Joe Black hadn't reported from the Dodgers up to last night.\" See also: - McGowan, Lloyd. \"Black, Roebuck Shelled by Richmond Artillery\". \"The Montreal Star\". June 3, 1954. \"Clyde Sukeforth, in the stands again, thought Black looked real good, figures him to win for the Royals \u2013 but Sukey can't get over Roeb####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####uck's wildness.\" - McGowan, Lloyd. \"Lehmann Lacks Usual Control As Royals Bow to Richmond\". \"The Montreal Star\". June 4, 1954. \"It was midnight when Max Macon and Clyde Sukeforth came into the lobby of the hotel. They weren't quite in complete accord as to why the Royals dropped another game to the Virginians 7\u20132.\" - McGowan, Lloyd. \"Bits From The Batter's Box\". \"The Montreal Star\". June 5, 1954. \"Clyde Sukeforth's attendance at the series between the Royals and Virginians was the cause of much conjecturing... Sukey managed the Royals when Max Macon played on the club a dozen years ago.\" Conducted by pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth, the mission's focus quickly shifted when he witnessed Clemente's throwing and batting prowess in pre-game drills. Nonetheless, Clemente barely played during Sukeforth's three-day visit. With his suspicions further aroused by manager Max Macon's dismissive remarks (\"You mean you want \"him\"?!\") and the fact that Clemente took batting practice with the pitchers rather than his fellow position players, Sukeforth made inquiries and soon ascertained Clemente's status as an unprotected####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### bonus baby. The manager had been instructed to use Clemente \"sparingly,\" acknowledged Macon almost 12 years later. \"We tried to sneak him through the draft, but it didn't work.\" As Sukeforth told Pirates beat writer Les Biederman, \"I knew then he'd be our first draft choice.\" Before leaving Richmond, he recalled, \"I told Montreal manager Max Macon to take good care of 'our boy' and see that he didn't get hurt.\" Evidently, Macon took Sukeforth at his word; scarcely had the Pirate scout departed when, on June 4, Clemente started his first game in over a month. In the course of two days and three games (two of which he started), Clemente amassed ten at-bats, two more than in the previous thirty games combined. Yet just as abruptly, the moment was over and he was back to riding the bench, this time for almost two months. Clemente's extra inning, walk-off home run of July 25, 1954, the first home run of his North American baseball career, was hit in his first at-bat after entering the game as a defensive replacement. Perhaps prompted by Sukeforth's followup visit (\"I don't care if you####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### never play him; we're going to finish last, and we're going to draft him number one\"), Clemente's appearance ended a nearly two-month-long drought starting on June 6 (17 appearances, 6 starts, and 24 at-bats in 60 games). From this point forward, Clemente's playing time increased significantly; he started every subsequent game against a left-handed starting pitcher, finishing the season with a batting average of.257 in 87 games. Clemente would complement his July 25 walk-off homer with another on September 5, as well as a game-ending outfield assist (cutting down the potential tying run at the plate) on August 18, his 20th birthday. As promised, the Pirates made Clemente the first selection of the Rule 5 draft that took place on November 22, 1954.</s><s>Major League Baseball (1955\u20131972). For all but the first seven weeks of his major league career, Clemente wore number 21, so chosen because his full name of Roberto Clemente Walker had that many letters. After his death, this number was retired by the Pirates. For his first few weeks, Clemente wore the number 13, as his teammate Earl Smith was wearing number 21. It was later reassigned to Clemente. During####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the off-seasons (except the 1958\u201359, 1962\u201363, 1965\u201366, 1968\u201369, 1971\u201372, and 1972\u201373 seasons), Clemente played professionally for the Santurce Crabbers, Criollos de Caguas, and San Juan Senadores in the Puerto Rican baseball winter league, where he was considered a star. He sometimes managed the San Juan team. In September 1958, Clemente joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He served his six-month active duty commitment at Parris Island, South Carolina, Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. At Parris Island, Clemente received recruit training with Platoon 346 of the 3rd Recruit Battalion. The rigorous Marine Corps training programs helped Clemente physically; he added strength by gaining ten pounds and said his back troubles (caused by being in a 1954 auto accident, see below) had disappeared. He was a private first class in the Marine Corps Reserve until September 1964.</s><s>Major League Baseball (1955\u20131972).:Pittsburgh Pirates, 1950s. The Pirates struggled through several difficult seasons through the 1950s. They did have a winning season in 1958, their first since 1948. Clemente debuted with####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Pirates on April 17, 1955, wearing uniform number 13, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Early in his career with the Pirates, he was frustrated by racial and ethnic tensions, with sniping by the local media and some teammates. Clemente responded to this by saying \"I don't believe in color.\" He said that, during his upbringing, he was taught never to discriminate against someone based on ethnicity. Clemente was at a double disadvantage, as he was a Latin American and Caribbean player whose first language was Spanish and was of partially African descent. The year before, the Pirates had hired Curt Roberts, their first African-American player. They were the fifth team in the NL and ninth in the major leagues to do so, seven years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color line by joining the Dodgers. When Clemente arrived in Pittsburgh, Roberts befriended him and helped him adjust to life in the major league, as well as in the Pittsburgh area. During his rookie season, Clemente had to sit out several games, as he had suffered a lower back injury in Puerto Rico the previous winter. A speeding, drunk driver rammed into his car at an intersection. He finished his rookie season with a.255 batting average, despite trouble####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### hitting certain types of pitches. His defensive skills were highlighted during this season. The following season, on July 25, 1956, in Forbes Field, Clemente hit the only documented walk-off, inside-the-park grand slam in modern MLB play. Pittsburgh-based sportswriter John Steigerwald said that it \"\"may\" have been done only once in the history of baseball.\" [Emphasis added.]) Clemente was still fulfilling his Marine Corps Reserve duty during spring of 1959 and set to be released from Camp Lejeune until April 4. A Pennsylvania state senator, John M. Walker, wrote to US Senator Hugh Scott requesting an early release on March 4 so Clemente could join the team for spring training.</s><s>Major League Baseball (1955\u20131972).:Pittsburgh Pirates, 1960s. Early in the 1960 season, Clemente led the league with a.353 batting average, and the 14 extra-base hits and 25 RBIs recorded in May alone resulted in Clemente's selection as the National League's Player of the Month. His batting average would remain above the.300 mark throughout the course of the campaign. On August 5 at Forbes Field, Clemente crashed into the right-field wall while making a pivotal play, depriving San####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Francisco's Willie Mays of a leadoff, extra-base hit in a game eventually won by Pittsburgh, 1\u20130. The resulting injury necessitated five stitches to the chin and a five-game layoff for Clemente, while the catch itself was described by Giants beat writer Bob Stevens as \"rank[ing] with the greatest of all time, as well as one of the most frightening to watch and painful to make.\" The Pirates compiled a 95\u201359 record during the regular season, winning the NL pennant, and defeated the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series. Clemente batted.310 in the series, hitting safely at least once in every game. His.314 batting average, 16 home runs, and defensive playing during the course of the season had earned him his first spot on the NL All-Star roster as a reserve player, and he replaced Hank Aaron in right field during the 7th and 8th innings in the second All-Star game held that season (two All-Star games were held each season from 1959 through 1962). During spring training in 1961, following advice from Pirates' batting coach George Sisler, Clemente tried to modify his batting technique by using a heavier bat to slow the speed of his swing. During####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the 1961 season, Clemente was named the starting NL right fielder for the first of two All-Star games and went 2 for 4; he hit a triple on his first at-bat and scored the team's first run, then drove in the second with a sacrifice fly. With the AL ahead 4\u20133 in the 10th inning, he teamed with fellow future HOFers Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, and Frank Robinson to engineer a come-from-behind 5\u20134 NL victory, culminating in Clemente's walk-off single off knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm. Clemente started again in right field for the second All-Star game held that season and was 0 for 2, flying and grounding out in the 2nd and 4th innings. That season he received his first Gold Glove Award. Following the 1961 season, he traveled to Puerto Rico along with Orlando Cepeda, who was a native of Ponce. When both players arrived, they were received by 18,000 people. During this time, he was also involved in managing the Senadores de San Juan of the Puerto Rican League, as well as playing with the team during the major league off-season. During the course of the winter league, Clemente injured his thigh####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### while doing some work at home but wanted to participate in the league's all-star game. He pinch-hit in the game and got a single, but experienced a complication of his injury as a result, and had to undergo surgery shortly after being carried off the playing field. This condition limited his role with the Pirates in the first half of the 1965 season, during which he batted.257. Although he was inactive for many games, when he returned to the regular starting lineup, he got hits in 33 out of 34 games and his batting average climbed up to.340. He participated as a pinch hitter and replaced Willie Stargell playing left field during the All-Star Game on July 15. Clemente was an All-Star every season he played in the 1960s other than 1968\u2014the only year in his career after 1959 in which he failed to hit above.300\u2014and a Gold Glove winner for each of his final 12 seasons, beginning in 1961. He won the NL batting title four times: 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and won the league's MVP Award in 1966, hitting.317 with a career-high 29 home runs and 119 RBIs. In 1967, Clemente registered a career-high.357 batting average, hit####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 23 home runs, and batted in 110 runs. Following that season, in an informal poll conducted by \"Sport Magazine\" at baseball's Winter Meetings, a plurality of major league GMs declared Clemente \"the best player in baseball today,\" edging out AL Triple Crown winner Carl Yastrzemski by a margin of 8 to 6, with one vote each going to Hank Aaron, Bob Gibson, Bill Freehan and Ron Santo. In an effort to make him seem more American, sportswriters started calling him Bob or Bobby and his baseball cards even listed him as Bob Clemente. He disliked the practice and asked that it be stopped.</s><s>Major League Baseball (1955\u20131972).:Pittsburgh Pirates, 1970s. The 1970 season was the last one that the Pirates played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium; for Clemente, abandoning this stadium was an emotional situation. The Pirates' final game at Forbes Field occurred on June 28, 1970. That day, Clemente said that it was hard to play in a different field, saying, \"I spent half my life there.\" The night of July 24, 1970, was declared \"Roberto Clemente Night\"; on this day, several Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Rivers Stadium and cheered Clemente while wearing traditional Puerto Rican attire. A ceremony to honor Clemente took place, during which he received a scroll with 300,000 signatures compiled in Puerto Rico, and several thousands of dollars were donated to charity work following Clemente's request. During the 1970 season, Clemente compiled a.352 batting average; the Pirates won the NL East pennant but were subsequently eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds. During the offseason, Roberto Clemente experienced some tense situations while he was working as manager of the Senadores and when his father, Melchor Clemente, experienced medical problems and underwent surgery. In the 1971 season, the Pirates won the NL East, defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games to win the NL pennant, and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. Baltimore had won 101 games (third season in row with 100+ wins) and swept the American League Championship Series, both for the third consecutive year, and were the defending World Series champions. The Orioles won the first two games in the series, but Pittsburgh won the championship in seven games. This marked the second occasion that Clemente helped win a World Series for the Pirates. Over the course of the series, Clemente had a.414 batting average (12 hits in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 29 at-bats), performed well defensively, and hit a solo home run in the deciding 2\u20131 seventh game victory. Following the conclusion of the season, he received the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.</s><s>Major League Baseball (1955\u20131972).:Pittsburgh Pirates, 1970s.:3,000th career hit. Although he was frustrated and struggling with injuries, Clemente played in 102 games and hit.312 during the 1972 season. He also made the annual NL All-Star roster for the twelfth time (he played in 14/15 All-Star games) and won his twelfth consecutive Gold Glove. On September\u00a030, he hit a double in the fourth inning off Jon Matlack of the New York Mets at Three Rivers Stadium for his 3,000th hit. It was his last regular season at-bat of his career. By playing in right field in one more regular season game, on October 3, Clemente tied Honus Wagner's record for games played as a Pittsburgh Pirate, with 2,433 games played. In the NL playoffs that season, he batted.235 as he went 4 for 17. His last game was October 11, 1972 at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium in the fifth and final game of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the 1972 NLCS. He and Bill Mazeroski were the last Pirate players remaining from the 1960 World Series championship team.</s><s>Personal life. Clemente was married on November 14, 1964, to Vera Zabala at San Fernando Church in Carolina. The couple had three children: Roberto Jr., born in 1965, Luis Roberto, born in 1966, and Roberto Enrique, born in 1969. Vera Clemente died on November 16, 2019, aged 78. Clemente was a devout Catholic. In the 1958\u201359 off-season, Clemente enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, and served during off-seasons through 1964. He was inducted into the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame in 2003, and into the Puerto Rican Veterans Hall of Fame 15 years later.</s><s>Charitable work and death. Clemente spent much of his time during the off-season involved in charity work. When Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, was affected by a massive earthquake on December 23, 1972, Clemente (who visited Managua three weeks before the quake) immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors. The airplane which he chartered for the New Year's Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (a flight engineer and a copilot were both missing), and it was also overloaded by. It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure. A search and rescue effort was immediately launched, led by the USCGC \"Sagebrush\". A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case which apparently belonged to Clemente was the only personal item of his which was recovered from the plane. Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguill\u00e9n was the only member of the Pirates who did not attend Roberto's memorial service. Instead, the Pirates catcher chose to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-engine plane were never recovered. Montreal Expos pitcher Tom Walker, then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico (in a league later named after Clemente), helped him load the plane. Because Clemente wanted Walker, who was single, to go and enjoy New Year's, Clemente told him not to join him on the flight. In an interview for the ESPN documentary series \"SportsCentury\" in 2002, Clemente's widow Vera mentioned that Clemente had told her that he thought he was going to die young several times. Indeed, while he was being asked when he would get his 3,000th career hit by broadcaster and future fellow Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn in July 1971 during the All-Star Game activities, Clemente's response was \"Well, uh, you never know. I, I, uh, if I'm alive, like I said before, you never know because God tells you how long you're going to be here. So you never know what can happen tomorrow.\" Clemente's older stepbrother, Luis, died on December 31, 1954, exactly 18 years before Clemente himself, and his stepsister died a few years later. At the time of his death, Clemente had established several records with the Pirates, including####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### most triples in a game (three) and hits in two consecutive games (ten). He won 12 Gold Glove Awards and shares the record of most won among outfielders with Willie Mays. On July 25, 1956, in a 9\u20138 Pittsburgh win against the Chicago Cubs, Clemente hit the only walk-off inside-the-park grand slam in professional baseball history.</s><s>Hall of Fame. On March 20, 1973, the Baseball Writers' Association of America held a special election for the Baseball Hall of Fame. They voted to waive the waiting period for Clemente, due to the circumstances of his death, and posthumously elected him for induction into the Hall of Fame, giving him 393 out of 420 available votes, for 92.7% of the vote. Clemente's Hall of Fame plaque originally had his name as \"Roberto Walker Clemente\" instead of the proper Spanish format \"Roberto Clemente Walker\"; the plaque was recast in 2000 to correct the error. Both plaques are currently on display in the Hall of Fame, the new one in the plaque gallery and the original in the \u201csandlot kids clubhouse\u201d area.</s><s>MLB awards and achievements.</s><s>MLB awards and achievements.:A####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####wards. - NL MVP Award (1966) - NL Player of the Month Award (May 1960, May 1967, July 1969) - World Series MVP Award (1971) - NL Gold Glove Award (1961\u20131972) - Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award (2006)</s><s>MLB awards and achievements.:Achievements. - NL All-Star (1960\u20131967, 1969\u20131972) - NL leader in batting average (1961, 1964, 1965, 1967) - NL leader in hits (1964, 1967) - NL leader in triples (1969) - NL leader in putouts as right fielder (1958, 1961, 1966) - NL leader in fielding average as right fielder and outfielder (1972)</s><s>Other honors and awards.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Gilberto Silva Gilberto Aparecido da Silva (; born 7 October 1976) is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder most notably for English Premier League club Arsenal, Super League club Panathinaikos F.C., Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro and the Brazil national team. Born and raised in poverty in the Brazilian municipality of Lagoa da Prata, Gilberto joined the youth academy at local club Am\u00e9rica Mineiro, where he made his senior debut as a centre-back in 1998. After starring the following season, where he helped gain the club promotion into the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A, he joined city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro. During his time at Atl\u00e9tico, Gilberto transitioned into a defensive midfielder under head coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, and flourished in his new role, gaining a call-up to the Brazil national team for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where he featured prominently as his country won the tournament. As a result of his World Cup performances, Gilberto garnered a move to the Premier League to sign for Arsenal that summer for a fee of \u00a34.5\u00a0million. During his six years at Arsenal, Gilberto gained a reputation as one####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of the best defensive midfielders in the world, and starred in a midfield duo alongside Patrick Vieira. He would feature as a member of the \"Invincibles\", where he captured his first top-flight league title as his team went undefeated the whole season, as well as winning two FA Cups. Gilberto also holds distinct records at Arsenal, recording their first goal at the Emirates Stadium, as well as their fastest ever goal, scoring in 21 seconds from kickoff against PSV Eindhoven in the 2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League. After departing Arsenal, Gilberto relocated to Greece, playing for Panathinaikos, where he won a domestic double. He then returned to Brazil in 2011, signing for Gr\u00eamio, where he remained for two years, before returning to Atl\u00e9tico to win the 2013 Copa Libertadores prior to retiring. Gilberto featured at senior level for much of his international career, representing Brazil over a period of 9 years. He enjoyed a period of sustained success with his country, as he featured prominently in their victorious campaign at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, as well as being a core component as the team also won the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, while also featuring as captain in their Copa Am\u00e9rica win####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in 2007. After retaining the Confederations Cup in 2009, Gilberto expressed his desire to prolong his club career, which coincided with limited playing time for Brazil. He retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having made 93 appearances for Brazil. Gilberto served as technical director at Panathinaikos in 2016.</s><s>Early life. As a child, Gilberto lived in the city of Lagoa da Prata with his father (a blacksmith), his mother (a housewife) and three sisters. His family lived in a small house which his father built, in the district of Usina Luci\u00e2nia. Despite financial hardship, causing his sisters and him to share a single room, he had a relatively carefree childhood: he describes it as \"[a time when] I had no responsibility in my life, I played football on the street with cousins and friends, and we never had any contact with drugs or violence\". In 1988 (aged 12), he got the chance to break out of poverty by playing football, joining Am\u00e9rica Mineiro as a youth player. It was during these years at Am\u00e9rica Mineiro that Gilberto was taught defensive discipline by playing as a central defender. When not playing football, Gilberto was taught####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### furniture-making skills by his father, which he would come to use in the following years. In 1991, Gilberto's father retired leaving the 16-year-old to provide financially for his whole family, a task made more difficult by his mother's ill-health. Because of the low wage at Am\u00e9rica Mineiro, he was forced to quit football to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this would be the end of his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about \u00a350 a month by 2002 rates.</s><s>Club career.</s><s>Club career.:Early career. In 1997, Gilberto's friends convinced him to give football another try, which led to him re-signing for Am\u00e9rica Mineiro in 1997, this time as a full-time professional. Aged 22, Gilberto played as a central defender for the first team. During his first season for Am\u00e9rica Mineiro he was regarded as a key player by the club, despite being criticised by some fans for inconsistency. He helped them win the S\u00e9rie B division, and consequently gain promotion to S\u00e9rie A. During Gilberto's third season at####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Am\u00e9rica Mineiro, with the team back to S\u00e9rie B after relegation in S\u00e9rie A in 1999, he scored three goals, helping the club reach the second stage where they were eliminated by Vila Nova in the quarterfinals. In 2000, aged 24, he joined rival club Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro. In his first season for the club, he fractured his right tibia and, as a result, missed a number of games. In his second season, he was moved by the manager Carlos Alberto Parreira from central defence to a defensive midfield role where he flourished. He scored three goals in the 2001 season and became a revelation in Brazilian club football.</s><s>Club career.:Arsenal. Gilberto's performance in the 2002 FIFA World Cup caught the attention of many coaches. Gilberto expressed a desire to move to England, saying, \"It would be fantastic to play against the likes of David Beckham again.\" \"All Things Footie Archive\". All Things Footie. 25 July 2002. Retrieved 25 September 2006. As a result, FA Premier League clubs Aston Villa and Arsenal led the chase to sign him. In August, while still under contract to Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, Gilberto joined Arsenal on their pre-season tour of Austria;####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### while he had not yet signed for Arsenal the deal looked set to go ahead. However, complications arose when a transfer embargo was placed on Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro due to unpaid wages to some players at the club, including Gilberto. There was also an issue of obtaining a UK work permit for Gilberto. Despite the complications, Gilberto ended a summer of speculation and joined Arsenal on 7 August 2002 for a fee of \u00a34.5\u00a0million. Upon signing Gilberto, Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said, \"What I like was the fact that he kept things simple. He can play all across the midfield but the holding role just in front of the defence is what he does best.\" When Gilberto moved to England and began training with Arsenal, he bought a house in St Albans, South Hertfordshire. Having been used to life in small Brazilian towns, he initially struggled to adapt to the new way of life in London. However, on the pitch, he settled in very quickly. On 11 August 2002 he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against Liverpool in the second half of the FA Community Shield game in which he scored the winning goal. As the 2002\u201303 FA Premier League season began, Gilberto faced stiff competition for a place in midfield from####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### compatriot Edu. After two substitute appearances, Gilberto finally broke into the starting eleven on 27 August, helping Arsenal to a 5\u20132 win against West Bromwich Albion. Gilberto's good form continued as he set a new record for the fastest goal scored in the UEFA Champions League, scoring after 20.07 seconds against PSV on 25 September 2002. 2003\u201304 was an even better season for Gilberto, as he was instrumental in helping Arsenal win the Premier League title whilst going the entire season unbeaten. He played in 32 of Arsenal's 38 unbeaten Premier League games during the season. His next season started equally impressively, as he scored the first goal in Arsenal's 3\u20131 Community Shield win over Manchester United at the Millennium Stadium. During the opening games of the season, he started to experience severe pain in his back, and after a match at Bolton Wanderers on 27 September 2004, a scan revealed he had fractured his back. At first it was reported that he would be out of action for a month. Later reports suggested the injury could be season-threatening. Gilberto's doctor ordered him to wear a back brace for three months to aid the healing of the fractured bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil for the duration of his rehabilitation. During his####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### time there, he doubted whether he would ever be able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4\u20131 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004\u201305 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him. In June 2005, football agent Jacques Lichtenstein took Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro to court over Gilberto's transfer in 2002. Lichtenstein's lawyer argued that he and his informal partner, Ronny Rosenthal, never received an allegedly agreed 10% commission from Gilberto's \u00a34.5\u00a0million transfer to Arsenal from Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro in July 2002. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein both gave evidence in court, saying that Arsenal dealt directly with Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro and that no agent was involved in the deal. The case was conducted before The Hon. Mr Justice Jack, who on 29 June ruled against Lich####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####tenstein, and ordered the claimants pay Atletico Min\u00e9iro \u00a394,000 in legal costs. A year later, the case could have caused problems for Arsenal, when former player Ashley Cole criticised the club for \"hypocrisy and double standards\" in the way they approached Gilberto. With legal matters subsided, the 2005\u201306 season began. Following midfielder and team captain Patrick Vieira's departure from Arsenal, Gilberto became a senior member of the Arsenal team. Shortly into the season, in September 2005, his desire to see his career out with the club led to Gilberto extending his Arsenal contract to June 2009. A month later this loyalty was repaid when, on 18 October 2005, Gilberto made his first appearance for Arsenal as captain, against Sparta Prague. Although Gilberto had a period of bad form during the winter months of the season, his good defensive performances during the latter stages of the UEFA Champions League (in particular, games against Real Madrid, Juventus \"\"Lehmann sends Gunners to Paris\". ESPN Soccernet. 25 April 2006. Retrieved 16 February 2014. and Villarreal) gained him praise. On 17 May 2006 Gilberto played for Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League Final against FC Barcelona, which Arsenal lost 2\u20131####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. Following the departure of defender Sol Campbell and retirement of striker Dennis Bergkamp in the summer of 2006, Gilberto was announced as Arsenal's vice-captain for the 2006\u201307 season. He began the season well, as he scored the first ever goal at the Dutch DSB Stadion in a pre-season friendly match. He then scored Arsenal's first ever goal in a competitive match at the Emirates Stadium in a 1\u20131 draw with Aston Villa. His good form continued for Arsenal as he scored several league goals, garnering praise for his performances as stand-in captain while Thierry Henry was injured. Gilberto and his agent (Paulo Villana) also reiterated the player's desire to honour his contract with the Gunners. Meanwhile, Gilberto's good form carried through to the second half of the season. Even though Arsenal only managed to finish fourth in the league, he ended the season as Arsenal's second highest scorer with 10 Premier League goals. The explanation for his unusually high tally is the fact that Henry suffered two lengthy injury spells, in which Gilberto stepped up as captain to take penalties. Gilberto's goal scoring record combined with his own good form in midfield and his leadership of Wenger's youthful squad led some Arsenal fans and football pundits####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to label Gilberto as Arsenal's best player of the season, and one of the best in the Premier League. The buildup of the 2007\u201308 season saw Arsenal captain Thierry Henry leave the club to join Barcelona. \"Thierry Henry signs for Barcelona\". nationmultimedia.com. 23 June 2007. Retrieved 22 July 2007. This coupled with the fact that Gilberto was Arsenal's vice-captain during the 2006\u201307 season led many people to assume that Gilberto would take over Henry's role. \"Wenger \u2013 Gilberto in frame for captaincy\".

In August, after returning to Arsenal's pre-season training late due to his involvement in the Copa Am\u00e9rica tournament (and thus missing the start of the season), Gilberto then lost his place in the first team to young midfielder Mathieu Flamini. This reignited speculation linking Gilberto to Italy due to rumours that he was unhappy being on the bench at Arsenal. However, reports that he was being snubbed at####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the club were dismissed by Wenger, who insisted that Gilberto would remain at Arsenal to fight for his place. \"Flying start gives Wenger selection headache\".

Despite this, in October 2007, rumours in the press re-emerged that Gilberto was angry at Wenger for being asked to play in defence in a League Cup game against Sheffield United, and had resultantly refused to play. Gilberto ended up playing the game in midfield though, with he and Wenger both denying rumours of a rift with each other. Gilberto subsequently commented that while he was not happy being a substitute, he would remain professional and fight for his place at the club. \"Gilberto \u2013 I am staying here to fight for my place\". Arsenal F.C. 7 November 2007. Retrieved 16 February 2014. Also in October, Gilberto ceded the Brazilian captaincy to L\u00facio upon his compatriot's return from injury. Through the winter months of the 2007\u201308 season, Gilberto started a limited number of games for the \"Gunners\", though he####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### kept his place in the Brazil team, starting several games for \"A Sele\u00e7\u00e3o\". Goal.com Dunga unworried by trouble at Morumbi. ESPN Soccernet. 20 November 2007. Retrieved 16 February 2014. After becoming more and more frustrated with not playing regularly, Gilberto admitted in February 2008 that he had been made to feel \"totally useless\" by Wenger. Despite this, he declined to make a decision on his future; something which prompted Wenger to promise talks with Gilberto. Amidst Gilberto's frustration at Arsenal, he targeted playing in Brazil's Olympic team in Beijing during August 2008; a competition which he had never played in. Off the pitch, Gilberto was reported to have passed his UK Citizenship test, and that he would subsequently apply for a British passport. April saw Gilberto's season take a turn for the better; making 5 starts \u2013 a substantial portion of his seasonal total of 12 \u2013 even managing to score a goal. The goal came against Reading on 19 April, and despite its deflective nature leading to some classing it as a possible own goal, the Premier League's Dubious Goals Committee eventually credited the goal to Gilberto. \"Dubious Goals Panel rule on Gilberto goal\". Arsenal F.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####C. 20 May 2008. Retrieved 26 May 2008. However, Gilberto's return to favour did not stop Arsenal's 2007\u201308 season ending trophyless. The club subsequently faced the possibility of several players leaving; among those rumoured to leave was Flamini, the player who had kept Gilberto out of the first team. The Frenchman ended up moving to A.C. Milan on 6 May, and a subsequent gap was left in the Arsenal midfield. Gilberto became less likely to leave the club during Summer 2008 as a result, and Wenger remarked that he wanted to keep Gilberto; \"Wenger wants Gilberto to stay\". Arsenal Mania. 5 May 2008.

Gilberto finished the 2007\u201308 season with 36 appearances for Arsenal, albeit only 12 of these being Premier League starts.</s><s>Club career.:Panathinaikos. Following Brazil's summer international games, he was seriously linked with a move to Greek club Panathinaikos. The speculation concluded when Gilberto agreed terms with the Athenian side on 17 July 2008, for an undisclosed fee. During his first season at the club, Gilberto helped the side reach the UEFA Champions League####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Round of 16. He managed to win both the 2009\u201310 Greek Championship and Cup with Panathinaikos, being the starting holding midfielder and producing numerous solid displays. In Gilberto's final home game for Panathinaikos on 23 May 2011, he scored the winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over PAOK, for the Greek UEFA Champions League playoffs. Two days later, he played his final game for the team, winning 2\u20130 against AEK Athens.</s><s>Club career.:Later career. On 23 May 2011, Gilberto ended his 9-year career in Europe by signing an 18-month deal with Gr\u00eamio, of Porto Alegre. In the past, Gilberto hinted that he may one day return to Brazil to play for Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro. After his football career finishes, he has said that he would like to, \"Live in a small farm and ride a horse and have all of my family next to me.\" On 10 November 2012, it was confirmed that Gilberto's wish would be granted, as he signed a pre-contract with \"Galo\". On 9 December 2012, Gilberto was welcomed at Aeroporto dos Confins by fans of Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, returning####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to the Belo Horizonte side after 11 years away. Gilberto spoke of winning the 2013 Copa Libertadores title upon his return. Gilberto achieved this wish on 24 July 2013, with a final victory over Club Olimpia of Paraguay. On 11 December 2015, after two years without a club, he officially announced his retirement as a footballer, intending to pursue a career as an international consultant for clubs and players.</s><s>International career. In October 2001, his good performances from that year earned Gilberto a call up to the Brazil national team (\"\"A Sele\u00e7\u00e3o\"\") by Luiz Felipe Scolari for the 2002 World Cup qualification games. He made his international debut against Chile on 7 October, coming on as a substitute. On 7 November, he made his debut in the starting line-up of the national team against Bolivia. His international career continued to flourish in early 2002: he scored twice against Bolivia and once against Iceland. In 2002, he was a surprise inclusion in the Brazil squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan. He was expected to play a small part in the tournament. However, defensive midfielder and Brazilian team captain Emerson was injured in training just before the first World Cup game. In####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### light of the setback, coach Scolari called upon Gilberto to fill the gap which Emerson left. Gilberto ended up playing in every minute of every match of the tournament, which Brazil went on to win. In the words of Veja magazine, Gilberto \"carried the piano for Ronaldo and Rivaldo to play their tunes on\". He was not without attacking use either, setting up Ronaldo's semi-final goal to put Brazil through to the final. It was Gilberto's performance in this tournament which led to him being classed as one of the top defensive midfielders in the world. On 22 June 2005, Gilberto played in Brazil's 2\u20132 draw against Japan, in his only game of the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. His absence as a first team regular could be explained by his lack of games, and thus match fitness, for Arsenal during the season leading up to the tournament. Gilberto's appearance in the tournament gained him a winners medal, as Brazil went on to win the competition.

Gilberto is often called \"the invisible wall\" in Brazil. His play often goes unnoticed as he positions himself between the two centre backs and the rest of midfield, breaking up opposition attacks before they gather momentum. In this role, he is a part of the defensive unit for both club and country. When playing, he is more passive than most players in defence. Rather than tackle an opponent, he is more likely to shadow him, thus pushing him back. As a result, he has an unusually clean record for a defensive midfielder: he has twice gone 45 games or more without receiving a single booking during his Arsenal career. \"Gilberto Silva Statistics\". Soccerbase. Retrieved 25 September 2006. Gilberto is good at helping to defend against opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, something to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited. Despite Gilberto's high pass completion####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### rate, \"Some interesting Opta stats\". Arsenal Mania. Retrieved 25 September 2006. his passing has been described as erratic in the past. According to ProZone (a data analysis system used by football managers) figures cited by \"The Sunday Times\" in January 2007, Gilberto was, together with Paul Scholes of Manchester United and Frank Lampard of Chelsea, one of the few midfielders in England to attain \"the elite Champions League level\" of performance.</s><s>Outside football. Gilberto is a patron of The Street League, a UK based charity which organises football matches for homeless people, refugees and asylum seekers. In June 2003, he travelled to Brazil on tour with 17 Street League players. The tour included a visit to his home town Lagoa da Prata and games against local shanty town teams at the Maracan\u00e3 stadium. For the 2014 World Cup, Silva worked for ESPN as a pundit. In May 2016, Gilberto joined Panathinaikos as technical director. He left in December, after seven months in the role. Gilberto is a keen musician.

After proving his versatility in other genres, notably in the period thriller \"Blood Rain\" (2005) and the melodrama \"My Son\" (2007), Cha's popularity continued with the television series \"Bodyguard\" (2003), \"City Hall\" (2009), \"The Greatest Love\" (2011), \"Hwayugi\" (2017), \"One Ordinary Day\" (2021), and \"Our Blues\" (2022).</s><s>Career. Cha dropped out of Sungkyunkwan University, and began a successful career as a fashion model in 1988. He was cast in the TV sitcom \"New York Story\", which would eventually pave the way for his debut in film. Although his debut film \"Holiday In Seoul\" (1997) and many of his subsequent roles did not establish him as a major star, he####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### attracted attention in 2000 for his performance as an arsonist in the firefighting film \"Libera Me\". The following summer, the runaway success of Kim Sang-jin's comedy \"Kick the Moon\" (over 4.3 million tickets sold) secured his place in the industry as a leading actor with strong star appeal. Since then, Cha has become one of the few surefire box office draws in the country. In a 2005 survey of influential movie producers, he was ranked among the top ten most bankable stars. In early 2003, Cha took on a slightly more serious role as a corrupt schoolteacher who is transferred to a country school in the film \"My Teacher, Mr. Kim\". The film grossed over 2.4 million admissions and drew Cha additional praise for his acting abilities (he would later team up again with director Jang Gyu-seong for 2007 comedy \"Small Town Rivals\"). His next role, in \"Ghost House\", reunited him with director Kim Sang-jin in a successful comedy about a man who buys a dream home, only to discover it is haunted by a young female ghost. In 2005 Cha put aside the comic roles he had become known for and appeared in the grisly period thriller \"Blood Rain\". The film's unexpectedly robust####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### commercial success confirmed Cha's popularity among Korean audiences. He further proved his versatility in Jang Jin's \"Murder, Take One\" (also known as \"The Big Scene\"). Cha starred in his first melodrama \"Over the Border\" (2006), about a North Korean defector. He then reunited with Jang Jin in \"My Son\" (2007), and he said his experience as a father helped a lot in learning the character. Stylish crime thrillers \"Eye for an Eye\" (2008), and \"Secret\" (2009) followed. Cha returned to television in 2009, in the political fairytale \"City Hall\" penned by writer Kim Eun-sook. 2010 was a busy year for him, with Cha appearing in two films, the Lee Joon-ik-helmed period actioner \"Blades of Blood\", and Korean War film \"\", followed by spy series \"\". In 2011 his character in the hit romantic comedy series \"The Greatest Love\", arrogant top star \"Dokko Jin,\" became a mini pop culture phenomenon, giving rise to numerous commercial deals and parodies, as well as awards for Cha. Cha made his theater debut in 2012 in the stage play \"Bring Me My Chariot Fire\" alongside Japanese actors####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, Ry\u014dko Hirosue, Teruyuki Kagawa, and Korean veteran actor Kim Eung-soo. Set in the historically turbulent early 1900s, the plot focuses on the friendship of artists from Korea and Japan who work together to preserve traditional Korean arts. In 2014, Cha signed with the talent agency YG Entertainment, then starred in the police series \"You're All Surrounded\". This was followed by his third team-up with director Jang Jin in the comedy noir film \"Man on High Heels\", which subverted Cha's \"macho\" image by having him play a transgender homicide detective.

Harrison Ford was born at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on July 13, 1942, to former radio actress Dorothy (n\u00e9e Nidelman) and advertising executive and former actor John William \"Christopher\" Ford. His younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945. Their father was a Catholic of German and Irish descent, while their mother was an Ashkenazi Jew whose parents were emigrants from Minsk, Belarus, then in the Russian Empire.Multiple sources: - - 'Keeping up with Indiana Jones', The Guardian, April 27, 2008 - -  When asked in which religion he and his brother####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### were raised, Ford jokingly responded \"Democrat\" and more seriously stated that they were raised to be \"liberals of every stripe\". When asked about what influence his Jewish and Irish Catholic ancestry may have had on him, he quipped, \"As a man I've always felt Irish, as an actor I've always felt Jewish.\" Ford was a Boy Scout, achieving the second-highest rank of Life Scout. He worked at Napowan Adventure Base Scout Camp as a counselor for the Reptile Study merit badge. Because of this, he and director Steven Spielberg later decided to depict the young Indiana Jones as a Life Scout in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (1989). Ford graduated in 1960 from Maine East High School in Park Ridge, Illinois. His voice was the first student voice broadcast on his high school's new radio station, WMTH, and he was its first sportscaster during his senior year. He attended Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin, where he was a philosophy major and a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. A self-described \"late bloomer\", Ford took a drama class in the final quarter of his senior year to get over his shyness and became fascinated with acting.</s><s>Career.</s><s>Career.:1964####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\u20131976. In 1964, after a season of summer stock with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin, Ford traveled to Los Angeles to apply for a job in radio voice-overs. He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a $150-per-week contract with Columbia Pictures' new talent program,, playing bit roles in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in \"Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round\" (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking (or \"extra\") roles in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokofsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor Tony Curtis delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy. His speaking roles continued next with \"Luv\" (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as \"Harrison J. Ford\" in the 1967 Western film \"A Time for Killing\", starring Glenn Ford, George Hamilton and Inger Stevens, but the \"J\" did not stand for anything since he has no middle name. It was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### added to avoid confusion with a silent film actor named Harrison Ford, who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ford soon dropped the \"J\" and worked for Universal Studios, playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including \"Gunsmoke\", \"Ironside\", \"The Virginian\", \"The F.B.I.\", \"Love, American Style\" and \"Kung Fu\". He appeared in the western \"Journey to Shiloh\" (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film \"Zabriskie Point\" as an arrested student protester. French filmmaker Jacques Demy chose Ford for the lead role of his first American film, \"Model Shop\" (1969), but the head of Columbia Pictures thought Ford had \"no future\" in the film business and told Demy to hire a more experienced actor. The part eventually went to Gary Lockwood. Ford later commented that the experience had been nevertheless a positive one because Demy was the first to show such####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### faith in him. Not happy with the roles offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two young sons. Clients at this time included the writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne, who lived on the beach at Malibu. Ford appears in the documentary \"\". He and his wife became friends of the writers. Casting director and fledgling producer Fred Roos championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with George Lucas for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in \"American Graffiti\" (1973). Ford's relationship with Lucas profoundly affected his career later. After director Francis Ford Coppola's film \"The Godfather\" was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, \"The Conversation\" (1974) and \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979); in the latter film, Ford played an army officer named \"G. Lucas\".</s><s>Career.:1977\u20131997. Ford began to receive bigger roles in films throughout the late 1970s, including \"Heroes\" (1977), \"Force 10 from Navarone\" (1978) and \"Hanover Street\" (1979). Ford also co-star####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####red alongside Gene Wilder in the buddy-comedy western \"The Frisco Kid\" (1979), playing a bank robber with a heart of gold. His previous work in \"American Graffiti\" eventually landed him his first starring film role when he was hired by Lucas to read lines for actors auditioning for roles in Lucas' upcoming epic space-opera film \"Star Wars\" (1977). Lucas was eventually won over by Ford's performance during these line reads and cast him as Han Solo. \"Star Wars\" became one of the most successful and groundbreaking films of all time, and brought Ford, and his co-stars Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, widespread recognition. He returned to star in the similarly successful \"Star Wars\" sequels \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) and \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), as well as the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\" (1978). Ford wanted Lucas to kill off Han Solo at the end of \"Return of the Jedi\", saying, \"That would have given the whole film a bottom,\" but Lucas refused. Ford's status as a leading actor was solidified with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), an action-adventure collaboration between George Lucas and Steven Spielberg that gave Ford his second franchise####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### role as the heroic, globe-trotting archaeologist Indiana Jones. Like \"Star Wars\", the film was massively successful and became the highest-grossing film of the year. Spielberg was interested in casting Ford from the beginning, but Lucas was not, having already worked with the actor in \"American Graffiti\" and \"Star Wars\". Lucas eventually relented after Tom Selleck was unable to accept. Ford went on to reprise the role throughout the rest of the decade in the prequel \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" (1984), and the sequel \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\". During the June 1983 filming of \"Temple of Doom\" in London, Ford herniated a disc in his back. The 40-year-old actor was forced to fly back to Los Angeles for surgery and returned six weeks later. Following his leading-man success as Indiana Jones, he played Rick Deckard in Ridley Scott's dystopian science-fiction film \"Blade Runner\" (1982). Compared to his experiences on the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films, Ford had a difficult time with the production. He recalled to Vanity Fair, \u201cIt was a long slog. I didn\u2019t really find it that physically difficult\u2014I thought it was mentally####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### difficult.\u201d Ford and Scott also had differing views on the nature of his character, Deckard, that persist decades later. While not initially a success, \"Blade Runner\" went on to become a cult classic and one of Ford's most highly regarded films. Ford also proved his versatility throughout the 1980s with dramatic parts in films such as \"Witness\" (1985), \"The Mosquito Coast\" (1986), and \"Frantic\" (1988) as well as the romantic male lead opposite Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver in the comedy-drama \"Working Girl\" (1988). \"Witness\" and \"The Mosquito Coast\" in particular allowed Ford to explore his potential as a dramatic actor and both performances were widely acclaimed. Ford later recalled that working with director Peter Weir on both \"Witness\" and \"The Mosquito Coast\" were two of the best experiences of his career. In the 1990s, Ford became the second actor to portray Jack Ryan in two films of the film series based on the literary character created by Tom Clancy: \"Patriot Games\" (1992) and \"Clear and Present Danger\" (1994), both co-starring Anne Archer and James Earl Jones. Ford took over the role from Alec Baldwin who had played Ryan in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"The Hunt for Red October\" (1990). This led to a long-lasting resentment from Baldwin who stated that he wanted to reprise the role but Ford had negotiated with Paramount behind his back. Ford also played leading roles in other action-based thrillers throughout the decade such as the critically acclaimed \"The Fugitive \"(1993), \"The Devil's Own\" (1997), and \"Air Force One\" (1997). For his performance in \"The Fugitive\", which also co-starred Tommy Lee Jones, Ford received some of the best reviews of his career, including from Roger Ebert who concluded that, \"Ford is once again the great modern movie everyman. As an actor, nothing he does seems merely for show, and in the face of this melodramatic material he deliberately plays down, lays low, gets on with business instead of trying to exploit the drama in meaningless acting flourishes.\" He also played more straight dramatic roles in \"Presumed Innocent\" (1990) and \"Regarding Henry\" (1991) as well as another romantic lead in \"Sabrina\" (1995), a remake of a classic 1954 film with the same name. Ford established working relationships with many well-regarded directors during this time, including Peter Weir, Alan J.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Pakula, Mike Nichols, Phillip Noyce, and Sydney Pollack, collaborating twice with each of them. This was the most lucrative period of Ford's career. From 1977 to 1997, he appeared in fourteen films that reached the top fifteen in the yearly domestic box office rankings, twelve of which reached the top ten. Six of the films he appeared in during this time were also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture amongst numerous other awards: \"Star Wars\", \"Apocalypse Now\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Witness\", \"Working Girl\", and \"The Fugitive\".</s><s>Career.:1998\u20132014. In the late 1990s, Ford started appearing in several critically derided and/or commercially disappointing films that failed to match his earlier successes, including \"Six Days, Seven Nights\" (1998), \"Random Hearts\" (1999), \"\" (2002), \"Hollywood Homicide\" (2003), \"Firewall\" (2006) and \"Extraordinary Measures\" (2010). One exception was \"What Lies Beneath\" (2000) which grossed over $155million in the United States and $291million worldwide. Ford served as an executive producer on \"K-19: The Widowmaker\" and \"Extraordinary Measures\", both####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of which were based on true events. In 2004, Ford declined a chance to star in the thriller \"Syriana\", later commenting that \"I didn't feel strongly enough about the truth of the material and I think I made a mistake.\" The role eventually went to George Clooney, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his work. Prior to that, Ford had passed on a role in another Stephen Gaghan-written film, that of Robert Wakefield in \"Traffic\", which eventually went to Michael Douglas. In 2008, Ford enjoyed success with the release of \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", the first Indiana Jones film in nineteen years and another collaboration with Lucas and Spielberg. The film received generally positive reviews and was the second highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008. Ford later said he would like to star in another sequel, \"...if it didn't take another 20 years to digest.\" Other 2008 work included \"Crossing Over\", directed by Wayne Kramer. In the film, Ford plays an ICE/Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent, working alongside Ashley Judd and Ray Liotta. He also narrated a feature documentary film about the Dalai Lama entitled \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\". Ford filmed the medical drama \"Extraordinary Measures\" in 2009####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in Portland, Oregon. Released January 22, 2010, the film also starred Brendan Fraser and Alan Ruck. Also in 2010, he co-starred in the film \"Morning Glory\", along with Rachel McAdams, Diane Keaton and Patrick Wilson. Although the film was a disappointment at the box office, Ford's performance was well received by critics, some of whom thought it was his best role in years. In July 2011, Ford starred alongside Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde in the science-fiction/western hybrid film \"Cowboys & Aliens\". To promote the film, Ford appeared at the San Diego Comic-Con International and, apparently surprised by the warm welcome, told the audience, \"I just wanted to make a living as an actor. I didn't know about this.\" Also in 2011, Ford starred in Japanese commercials advertising the video game \"\" for the PlayStation 3. 2013 began a trend that saw Ford accepting more diverse supporting roles. That year, Ford co-starred in the corporate espionage thriller \"Paranoia\" with Liam Hemsworth and Gary Oldman, who he had previously worked with in \"Air Force One\", and he also appeared in \"Ender's Game\", \"42\" and \"\". His performance as Branch Rickey in the film \"42\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### was praised by many critics and garnered Ford a nomination as best supporting actor for the Satellite Awards. In 2014, he appeared in \"The Expendables 3\" and the documentary \"\". The next year, Ford co-starred with Blake Lively in the romantic drama \"The Age of Adaline\" to positive notices.</s><s>Career.:2015\u2013present. Ford reprised the role of Han Solo in the long-awaited Star Wars sequel \"\" (2015), which became highly successful like its predecessors. During filming on June 11, 2014, Ford suffered what was said to be a fractured ankle when a hydraulic door fell on him. He was airlifted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, for treatment. Ford's son Ben released details on his father's injury, saying that his ankle would likely need a plate and screws, and that filming could be altered slightly with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. Ford made his return to filming in mid-August, after a two-month layoff as he recovered from his injury. Ford's character was killed off in \"The Force Awakens\", but it was subsequently announced, via a casting call, that Ford would return in some capacity as Solo in \"Episode VIII####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\". In February 2016, when the cast for \"Episode VIII\" was confirmed, it was indicated that Ford would not reprise his role in the film after all. When Ford was asked if his character could come back in \"some form\", he replied, \"Anything is possible in space.\" He eventually made an uncredited appearance as a vision in \"\" (2019). On February 26, 2015, Alcon Entertainment announced Ford would reprise his role as Rick Deckard in \"Blade Runner 2049\". The film, and Ford's performance, was very well received by critics upon its release in October 2017. Scott Collura of IGN called it a, \"deep, rich, smart film that's visually awesome and full of great sci-fi concepts\" and Ford's role, \"a quiet, sort of gut-wrenching interpretation to Deckard and what he must've gone through in the past three decades.\" The film grossed $259.3million worldwide, far short of the estimated $400million that the film needed in order to break even. In 2019, Ford had his first voice role in an animated film, as a dog named Rooster in \"The Secret Life of Pets 2\". With filming for a fifth \"Indiana Jones\" film having been delayed by a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### year, Ford headlined a big-budget adaptation of Jack London's \"The Call of the Wild\", playing prospector John Thornton. The film was released in February 2020 to a mixed critical reception but its theatrical release was shortened due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Ford will reprise the role of Indiana Jones in \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" (2023), which he has said will be his last appearance as the character. In October 2022, Ford was cast as Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross in the 2024 films \"\" and \"Thunderbolts\", set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, replacing actor William Hurt who played the character in previous MCU films.</s><s>Personal life. Ford has been married three times and has four biological children and one adopted child. He was first married to Mary Marquardt from 1964 until their divorce in 1979. They had two sons, chef and restaurateur Benjamin (born 1966) and clothier Willard (born 1969). Benjamin co-owns Ford's Filling Station, a gastropub with locations at L.A. Live in Los Angeles and Terminal 5 in Los Angeles International Airport. Willard is the owner of Strong Sports Gym, and was co-####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####owner of the Kim Sing Theater and owner of the Ludwig Clothing company. Ford's second marriage was to screenwriter Melissa Mathison from March 1983 until their separation in 2000 and finalized divorce in 2004. They had a son, actor and musician Malcolm (born 1987), and a daughter, actress Georgia (born 1990). Mathison died in 2015. Ford began dating actress Calista Flockhart after they met at the 2002 Golden Globe Awards. He proposed to Flockhart over Valentine's Day weekend in 2009. They married on June 15, 2010, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Ford was filming \"Cowboys & Aliens\". They are the parents of Liam (born 2001), the son she adopted before meeting Ford. Ford and Flockhart live on an ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, on which he has lived since the 1980s and approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. They retain a base in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. He is one of Hollywood's most private actors, guarding much of his personal life. In her 2016 autobiography \"The Princess Diarist\", his co-star Carrie Fisher claimed that she and Ford had a three-month affair in 1976 during the filming of \"Star Wars\".</s><s>Aviation. Ford is a licensed####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. On several occasions, he has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities in Wyoming, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour (), he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft in which he made his first solo flight. Ford's aircraft is kept at Santa Monica Airport. The Bell 407 is often kept and flown in Jackson and has been used by the actor in two mountain rescues during his assigned duty time with Teton County Search and Rescue. On one of the rescues, Ford recovered a hiker who had become lost and disoriented. She boarded Ford's helicopter and promptly vomited into one of the rescuers' caps, unaware of who the pilot was until much later; \"I####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### can't believe I barfed in Harrison Ford's helicopter!\" she said later. Ford flies his de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver (N28S) more than any of his other aircraft, and has repeatedly said that he likes this aircraft and the sound of its Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial engine. According to Ford, it had been flown in the CIA's Air America operations and was riddled with bullet holes that had to be patched up. In March 2004, Ford officially became chairman of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)'s Young Eagles program, founded by then-EAA president Tom Poberezny and fellow actor-pilot Cliff Robertson. Ford was asked to take the position by Greg Anderson, Senior Vice President of the EAA at the time, to replace General Chuck Yeager, who was vacating the post that he had held for many years. Ford at first was hesitant, but later accepted the offer and has made appearances with the Young Eagles at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh gathering at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, for two years. In July 2005, at the gathering in Oshkosh, Ford agreed to accept the position for another two years. He has flown over 280 children as part of the Young Eagles####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### program, usually in his DHC-2 Beaver, which can seat the actor and five children. Ford stepped down as program chairman in 2009 and was replaced by Captain Chesley Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles. He is involved with the EAA chapter in Driggs, Idaho, just over the Teton Range from Jackson, Wyoming. On July 28, 2016, Ford flew the two millionth Young Eagle at the EAA AirVenture convention, making it the most successful aviation-youth introduction program in history. As of 2009, Ford appears in Internet advertisements for General Aviation Serves America, a campaign by the advocacy group Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA). He has also appeared in several independent aviation documentaries, including \"Wings Over the Rockies\" (2009), \"\" (2014) and \"Living in the Age of Airplanes\" (2015). Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope, and is known for having made several trips to Washington, D.C., to fight for pilots' rights. He has also donated substantial funds to aerobatic champion Sean Tucker's charitable program, The Bob Hoover Academy (named after legendary aviator Bob Hoover) which educates at-risk teens in central California and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### teaches them how to fly.</s><s>Aviation.:Incidents. On August 22, 1987, Ford was traveling with Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke aboard a Gulfstream III when the jet developed trouble during a Paris-to-L.A. flight and was forced to land in Bangor, Maine. The trio spent the night at a hotel and after repairs and refueling resumed their flight the following day. On October 23, 1999, Ford was involved in the crash of a Bell 206L4 LongRanger helicopter. The NTSB accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California, on a routine training flight. While making his second attempt at an autorotation with powered recovery, the aircraft was unable to recover power after the sudden drop in altitude. It landed hard and began skidding forward in the loose gravel before flipping onto its side. Neither Ford nor the instructor pilot suffered any injuries, though the helicopter was seriously damaged. On March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries. On February 13, 2017, Ford landed an Aviat Husky at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, on the taxiway left of runway 20L. A Boeing 737 was holding short of the runway on the taxiway when Ford overflew them. On April 24, 2020, at the Los Angeles Hawthorne Airport while piloting his Husky, Ford crossed a runway where another aircraft was landing. According to the FAA, the two planes were about 3,600 feet from each other and there was no danger of a crash. A representative of Ford later said that he \"misheard\" an instruction given to him by air traffic control.</s><s>Activism.</s><s>Activism.:Environmental work. Ford is vice-chair of Conservation International, an American nonprofit environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. The organization's intent is to protect nature. In September 2013, Ford, while filming an environmental documentary in Indonesia, interviewed the Indonesian Forestry Minister, Zulkifli Hasan. After the interview, Ford and his crew were accused of \"harassing state institutions\" and publicly threatened with deportation. Questions within the interview concerned the Tesso N####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ilo National Park, Sumatra. It was alleged the Minister of Forestry was given no prior warning of questions nor the chance to explain the challenges of catching people with illegal logging. Ford was provided an audience with the Indonesian President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, during which he expressed concerns regarding Indonesia's environmental degradation and the government efforts to address climate change. In response, the President explained Indonesia's commitment to preserving its oceans and forests. In 1993, the arachnologist Norman Platnick named a new species of spider \"Calponia harrisonfordi\", and in 2002, the entomologist Edward O. Wilson named a new ant species \"Pheidole harrisonfordi\" (in recognition of Harrison's work as Vice Chairman of Conservation International). Since 1992, Ford has lent his voice to a series of public service messages promoting environmental involvement for EarthShare, an American federation of environmental and conservation charities. He has acted as a spokesperson for Restore Hetch Hetchy, a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring Yosemite National Park's Hetch Hetchy Valley to its original condition. Ford also appears in the documentary series \"Years of Living Dangerously\", which reports on people affected by and seeking solutions to climate change.

In 2003, he publicly condemned the Iraq War and called for \"regime change\" in the United States. He also criticized Hollywood for making movies which were \"more akin to video games than stories about human life and relationships\", and he called for more gun control in the United States. After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his favorite role of Ford's was \"Air Force One\" because he \"stood up for America\", Ford####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### responded that it was just a film and made critical statements against Trump's presidential bid. For his first time ever endorsing a political candidate for office, Ford endorsed Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign against Donald Trump. He said that he wanted to \"encourage people to support candidates that will support the environment\" and felt that under Trump, the United States has \"lost some of our credibility in the world\". Along with Mark Hamill, Ford worked with the anti-Trump Republican group The Lincoln Project to produce and narrate a 2020 election ad attacking Trump's disparaging of Anthony Fauci. In 2009, Ford signed a petition calling for the release of film director Roman Polanski, who had been arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.</s><s>Activism.:Archaeology.

Sixx was partially raised by his single mother, Deana Richards, and by his grandparents after his father left the family. Feranna later moved in with his grandparents after his mother abandoned him. Feranna relocated several times while living with his grandparents. Feranna's uncle, husband of Deana's sister Sharon, is Don Zimmerman, producer and president of Capitol Records. Feranna had one full biological sister, Lisa (born with Down syndrome; died circa 2000) and has one (half) brother Rodney Anthony Feranna (born 1966) and a half-sister Ceci. Feranna grew up####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### listening to Deep Purple, Harry Nilsson, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Elton John, Queen, and Black Sabbath; he later discovered T. Rex, David Bowie, and Slade. While living in Jerome, Idaho, Feranna's youth was troubled; he became a teenage vandal, broke into neighbors' homes, shoplifted, and was expelled from school for selling drugs. His grandparents sent him to live with his mother, who had moved to Seattle. Feranna lived there for a short time and learned how to play the bass guitar, having bought his first instrument with money gained from selling a guitar he had stolen.</s><s>Career.</s><s>Career.:Early career, Sister, London (1975\u20131979). At the age of 17, Feranna moved to Los Angeles and worked menial jobs such as working at a liquor store and selling vacuum cleaners over the phone while he auditioned for bands. He eventually joined the band Sister, led by Blackie Lawless, after answering an ad in \"The Recycler\" for a bass player. Soon after recording a demo, Feranna was fired from Sister along with bandmate Lizzie Grey. Feranna and Grey formed the band London soon afterward, in 1978. During this time,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Feranna legally changed his name to Nikki Sixx. After a number of lineup changes, London added former Mott the Hoople singer Nigel Benjamin to the group, and recorded a 16-track demo in Burbank. After the departure of Benjamin, along with the failure to find a replacement, Sixx departed London. The group would go on to feature Sixx's former Sister bandmate Blackie Lawless (later of W.A.S.P.), Izzy Stradlin (then of Hollywood Rose, later of Guns N' Roses) and drummer Fred Coury (later of Cinderella). In 2000, a number of the London demos recorded with Sixx were included on \"London Daze\" by Spiders & Snakes, led by former London guitarist Lizzie Grey.</s><s>Career.:M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce (1981\u2013present).

The latter ended up being their most successful record, staying in the charts for 114 weeks after its release. During his time with M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Sixx became addicted to heroin. He is quoted in \"The Heroin Diaries\" as saying: \"Alcohol, acid, cocaine... they were just affairs. When I met heroin it was true love.\" He estimates he overdosed \"about half a dozen times\". On December 23, 1987, Sixx overdosed on heroin and was reportedly declared clinically dead for two minutes before a paramedic revived him with two syringes full of adrenaline. After releasing the compilation album \"Decade of Decadence\" in 1991, Neil left the group, and was replaced by John Corabi, who formerly served with The Scream. They released one self titled album with Corabi, in 1994, before firing him in 1996.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Afterwards, they reunited with Neil, with whom they released \"Generation Swine\" in 1997.

Sixx is most often seen playing Gibson Thunderbird basses. Between 2000 and 2003 Gibson produced the Nikki Sixx Signature Blackbird. The Gibson Blackbird was for all intents and purposes a standard Thunderbird bass, but with a satin black finish, Iron Crosses on the fretboard instead of dots, an Iron Cross behind the classic Thunderbird logo, and Nikki Sixx's 'opti-grab' (a metal loop installed behind the bridge for hooking the little finger onto while playing). What also made this bass interesting was the lack of volume or tone controls, being replaced by a single on/off switch. Although subtle, this helped give this Blackbird more tone and a higher output. This model was discontinued in 2003, but has recently been put back in production as the Epiphone Nikki Sixx Blackbird. Cosmetically the Epiphone Blackbird is identical to the Gibson####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### original, but with a bolt-on single ply neck, solid mahogany body, different pickups and lower grade parts and manufacturing. The Epiphone model still kept the 'opti-grab,' designed and made first by his bass technician Tim Luzzi, and single on/off switch of the Gibson original. In 2008, Gibson announced a 'limited run' new Nikki Sixx signature bass. Like the original it features a neck through design made of mahogany and walnut, with maple 'wings' to form the body. Unlike the original 'Blackbird' bass, a clear'satin black cherry' finish is given to the instrument, with red'slash' X's on the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 12th frets. A mirror pickguard is also applied, with a red signature and two X's (6 x's on the whole bass) is also a new addition. Unlike the Gibson Blackbird, the new signature featured volume and tone controls, the 'opti-grab', and an on/off switch.</s><s>Personal life. Sixx was engaged to Denise \"Vanity\" Matthews in 1987.

She was a wild black chick who had sung with Prince: she'd also been his lover for a while. At the time I thought of Vanity as a disposable human being, like a used needle. Once its purpose was fulfilled it was ready for the trash, only to be dug up if you were really desperate\u2026We became drug buddies: sometimes, you could even just about call us boyfriend and girlfriend. Vanity also taught me how to really freebase: the first time I based was with Tommy when M\u00f6tley just started and only a few times after that. So up until then, I'd been mostly snorting or injecting. But as soon as she showed me the real ins and outs of cooking up a good rock\u2026it was love. Not her.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>James Taylor James Vernon Taylor (born March 12, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. Taylor is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Taylor achieved his breakthrough in 1970 with the single \"Fire and Rain\" and had his first hit in 1971 with his recording of \"You've Got a Friend\", written by Carole King in the same year. His 1976 \"Greatest Hits\" album was certified Diamond and has sold 12 million copies in the US alone. Following his 1977 album \"JT\", he has retained a large audience over the decades. Every album that he released from 1977 to 2007 sold over 1 million copies. He enjoyed a resurgence in chart performance during the late 1990s and 2000s, when he recorded some of his most-awarded work (including \"Hourglass\", \"October Road\", and \"Covers\"). He achieved his first number-one album in the US in 2015 with his recording \"Before This World\". Taylor is also known for his covers, such as \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\" and \"Handy####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Man\", as well as originals such as \"Sweet Baby James\". He played the leading role in Monte Hellman's 1971 film \"Two-Lane Blacktop\".</s><s>Early years. James Vernon Taylor was born at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on March 12, 1948. His father, Isaac M. Taylor, worked as a resident physician at the hospital and came from a wealthy Southern family. Taylor is of English and Scottish descent from the Taylor family of the Montrose area, with the former being rooted in Massachusetts Bay Colony; his ancestors include Edmund Rice, an English colonist who co-founded Sudbury, Massachusetts. His mother, Gertrude (n\u00e9e Woodard; 1921\u20132015), studied singing with Marie Sundelius at the New England Conservatory of Music and was an aspiring opera singer before she married Isaac in 1946. Taylor is the younger brother of musician Alex Taylor (1947\u20131993) and the older brother of musicians Kate Taylor (born 1949) and Livingston Taylor (born 1950). His youngest sibling, a brother named Hugh (born 1952), was also a musician; Hugh eventually left the music industry and has operated The Outermost Inn, a bed-and-breakfast in Aquinnah, Massachusetts, with his wife since 1989. In####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 1951, Taylor and his family moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, when Isaac took a job as an assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. They built a house in the Morgan Creek area off the present Morgan Creek Road, which was sparsely populated. James later said, \"Chapel Hill, the Piedmont, the outlying hills, were tranquil, rural, beautiful, but quiet. Thinking of the red soil, caused by local copper mining (Taylor's later song, \"Copperline\" was a nostalgic salute to that area where Taylor grew up), plus the seasons, the way things smelled down there, I feel as though my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people.\" James attended a public primary school in Chapel Hill. Isaac's career prospered, but he was frequently away from home on military service at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland or as part of Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica in 1955 and 1956. Isaac Taylor later rose to become dean of the UNC School of Medicine from 1964 to 1971. Beginning in 1953, the Taylors spent summers on Martha's Vineyard. Taylor took cello lessons as a child in North Carolina, before learning the guitar in 1960. His guitar####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### style evolved, influenced by hymns, carols, and the music of Woody Guthrie, and his technique derived from his bass clef-oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate's keyboards: \"My style was a finger-picking style that was meant to be like a piano, as if my thumb were my left hand, and my first, second, and third fingers were my right hand.\" Spending summer holidays with his family on Martha's Vineyard, he met Danny Kortchmar, an aspiring teenage guitarist from Larchmont, New York. The two began listening to and playing blues and folk music together, and Kortchmar felt that Taylor's singing had a \"natural sense of phrasing, every syllable beautifully in time. I knew James had that \"thing\".\" Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at 14, and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly. By the summer of 1963, he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard, billed as \"Jamie & Kootch\". In 1961, Taylor went to Milton Academy, a preparatory boarding school in Massachusetts. He faltered during his junior year, feeling uneasy in the high-pressure college prep environment despite having a good scholastic####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### performance. The Milton headmaster later said, \"James was more sensitive and less goal-oriented than most students of his day.\" He returned home to North Carolina to finish out the semester at Chapel Hill High School. There he joined a band formed by his brother Alex called The Corsayers (later The Fabulous Corsairs), playing electric guitar; in 1964, they cut a single in Raleigh that featured James's song \"Cha Cha Blues\" on the B-side. Having lost touch with his former school friends in North Carolina, Taylor returned to Milton for his senior year, where he started applying to colleges to complete his education. But he felt part of a \"life that [he was] unable to lead\", and he became depressed; he slept 20 hours each day, and his grades collapsed. In late 1965 he committed himself to McLean, a psychiatric hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, where he was treated with chlorpromazine, and where the organized days began to give him a sense of time and structure. As the Vietnam War escalated, Taylor received a psychological rejection from Selective Service System when he appeared before them with two white-suited McLean assistants and was uncommunicative. Taylor earned a high school diploma in 1966 from the hospital's associated Arlington School####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. He later viewed his nine-month stay at McLean as \"a lifesaver... like a pardon or like a reprieve\", and both his brother Livingston and his sister Kate later were patients and students there as well. As for his mental health struggles, Taylor thought of them as innate and said: \"It's an inseparable part of my personality that I have these feelings.\"</s><s>Career.</s><s>Career.:1966\u20131969: Early career. At Kortchmar's urging, Taylor checked himself out of McLean and moved to New York City to form a band. They recruited Joel O'Brien, formerly of Kortchmar's old band King Bees to play drums, and Taylor's childhood friend Zachary Wiesner (son of academic Jerome Wiesner) to play bass. After Taylor rejected the notion of naming the group after him, they called themselves the Flying Machine. They played songs that Taylor had written at and about McLean, such as \"Knocking 'Round the Zoo\", \"Don't Talk Now\", and \"The Blues Is Just a Bad Dream\". In some other songs, Taylor romanticized his life, but he was plagued by self-doubt. By summer 1966, they were performing regularly at the high-####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####visibility Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village, alongside acts such as the Turtles and Lothar and the Hand People. Taylor associated with a motley group of people and began using heroin, to Kortchmar's dismay. In a late 1966 hasty recording session, the group cut a single, Taylor's \"Night Owl\", backed with his \"Brighten Your Night with My Day\". Released on Jay Gee Records, a subsidiary of Jubilee Records, it received some radio airplay in the Northeast, but only charted at nationally. Other songs had been recorded during the same session, but Jubilee declined to go forward with an album. After a series of poorly-chosen appearances outside New York, culminating with a three-week stay at a failing nightspot in Freeport, Bahamas for which they were never paid, the Flying Machine broke up. (A UK band with the same name emerged in 1969 with the hit song \"Smile a Little Smile for Me\". The New York band's recordings were later released in 1971 as \"James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine\".) Taylor would later say of this New York period, \"I learned a lot about music and too much about drugs.\" Indeed, his drug use had developed into full-blown heroin addiction####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### during the final Flying Machine period: \"I just fell into it, since it was as easy to get high in the Village as get a drink.\" He hung out in Washington Square Park, playing guitar to ward off depression and then passing out, letting runaways and criminals stay at his apartment. Finally out of money and abandoned by his manager, he made a desperate call one night to his father. Isaac Taylor flew to New York and staged a rescue, renting a car and driving all night back to North Carolina with James and his possessions. Taylor spent six months getting treatment and making a tentative recovery; he also required a throat operation to fix vocal cords damaged from singing too harshly. Taylor decided to try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After recording some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A&R head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"Something in the Way She Moves\", to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: \"I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great... and he came and played live, so it was just like, 'Wow, he's \"great\".'\" Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for \"opening the door\" to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, \"I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen in anybody before.\" Living chaotically in various places with various women, Taylor wrote additional material, including \"Carolina in My Mind\", and rehearsed with a new backing band. Taylor recorded what would become his first album from July to October 1968, at Trident Studios, at the same time the Beatles were recording \"The White Album\". McCartney and an uncredited George Harrison guested on \"Carolina in My Mind\", whose lyric \"holy host of others standing around me\" referred to the Beatles, and the title phrase of Taylor's \"Something in the Way She####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Moves\" provided the lyrical starting point for Harrison's classic \"Something\". McCartney and Asher brought in arranger Richard Anthony Hewson to add both orchestrations to several of the songs and unusual \"link\" passages between them; they would receive a mixed reception, at best. During the recording sessions, Taylor fell back into his drug habit by using heroin and methedrine. He underwent physeptone treatment in a British program, returned to New York and was hospitalized there, and then finally committed himself to the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, which emphasized cultural and historical factors in trying to treat difficult psychiatric disorders. Meanwhile, Apple released his debut album, \"James Taylor\", in December 1968 in the UK and February 1969 in the US. Critical reception was generally positive, including a complimentary review in \"Rolling Stone\" by Jon Landau, who said that \"this album is the coolest breath of fresh air I've inhaled in a good long while. It knocks me out.\" The record's commercial potential suffered from Taylor's inability to promote it because of his hospitalization, and it sold poorly; \"Carolina in My Mind\" was released as a single but failed to chart in the UK and only reached on the U.S.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### charts. In July 1969, Taylor headlined a six-night stand at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. On July 20, he performed at the Newport Folk Festival as the last act and was cheered by thousands of fans who stayed in the rain to hear him. Shortly thereafter, he broke both hands and both feet in a motorcycle accident on Martha's Vineyard and was forced to stop playing for several months. However, while recovering, he continued to write songs and in October 1969 signed a new deal with Warner Bros. Records.</s><s>Career.:1970\u20131972: Warner Bros. and career breakthrough. Once he had recovered, Taylor moved to California, keeping Asher as his manager and record producer. In December 1969, he held the recording sessions for his second album there. Titled \"Sweet Baby James\", and featuring the participation of Carole King, the album was released in February 1970 and was Taylor's critical and popular breakthrough, buoyed by the single \"Fire and Rain\", a song about both Taylor's experiences attempting to break his drug habit by undergoing treatment in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend, Suzanne Schnerr. Both the album and the single reached on the \"Billboard\" charts, with \"Sweet Baby James\" selling more than 1.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####5\u00a0million copies in its first year and eventually more than 3 million in the United States alone. \"Sweet Baby James\" was received at its time as a folk-rock masterpiece, an album that effectively showcased Taylor's talents to the mainstream public, marking a direction he would take in following years. It earned several Grammy Award nominations including one for Album of the Year. It went on to be listed at on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, with \"Fire and Rain\" listed as on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004. During the time that \"Sweet Baby James\" was released, Taylor appeared with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys in a Monte Hellman film, \"Two-Lane Blacktop\". In October 1970, he performed with Joni Mitchell, Phil Ochs, and the Canadian band Chilliwack at a Vancouver benefit concert that funded Greenpeace's protests of 1971 nuclear weapons tests by the US Atomic Energy Commission at Amchitka, Alaska; this performance was released in album format in 2009 as \"Amchitka, The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace\". In January 1971, sessions for Taylor's next album began. He appeared on \"The Johnny Cash Show\", singing \"Sweet Baby James\", \"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####Fire and Rain\", and \"Country Road\", on February 17, 1971. His career success at this point and appeal to female fans of various ages piqued tremendous interest in him, prompting a March 1, 1971, \"Time\" magazine cover story of him as \"the face of new rock\". It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of \"Wuthering Heights\" Heathcliff and to \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\", and said, \"Taylor's use of elemental imagery\u2014darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled, to fears spoken and left unsaid\u2014reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music.\" One of the writers described his look as \"a cowboy Jesus\", to which Taylor later replied, \"I thought I was trying to look like George Harrison.\" Released in April 1971, \"Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon\" also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor's biggest hit single in the US, a version of Carole King's new \"You've Got a Friend\" (featuring backing vocals by Joni Mitchell), which reached on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, \"Long Ago and Far Away####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\", also made the Top 40 and reached on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart. The album itself reached on the album charts, which would be Taylor's highest position ever until the release of his 2015 album, \"Before This World\", which went to superseding Taylor Swift. In early 1972, Taylor won his first Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male, for \"You've Got a Friend\"; King also won Song of the Year for the same song in that ceremony. The album went on to sell 2.5\u00a0million copies in the United States. November 1972 heralded the release of Taylor's fourth album, \"One Man Dog\". A concept album primarily recorded in his home recording studio, it featured a cameo by Linda Ronstadt along with Carole King, Carly Simon, and John McLaughlin. The album consisted of eighteen short pieces of music put together. Reception was generally lukewarm and, despite making the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Album Charts, its overall sales were disappointing. The lead single, \"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\", peaked at on the Hot 100, and the follow-up, \"One Man Parade\", barely reached the Top 75. Almost simultaneously, Taylor married fellow singer-songwriter Carly Simon####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### on November 3, in a small ceremony at her Murray Hill, Manhattan apartment. A post-concert party following a Taylor performance at Radio City Music Hall turned into a large-scale wedding party, and the Simon-Taylor marriage would find much public attention over the following years. They had two children, Sarah Maria \"Sally\" Taylor, born January 7, 1974, and Benjamin Simon \"Ben\" Taylor, born January 22, 1977. During their marriage, the couple would guest on each other's albums and have two hit singles as duet partners: a cover of Inez & Charlie Foxx's \"\" and a version of The Everly Brothers' \"Devoted to You\".</s><s>Career.:1973\u20131976: Continued success and \"Greatest Hits\". Taylor spent most of 1973 enjoying his new life as a married man and did not return to the recording studio until January 1974, when sessions for his fifth album began. \"Walking Man\" was released in June and featured appearances of Paul and Linda McCartney and guitarist David Spinozza. The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner. It received poor reviews and sold only 300,000 copies in the United States. The title track failed to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### appear on the Top 100. However, Taylor's artistic fortunes spiked again in 1975 when the Gold album \"Gorilla\" reached and provided one of his biggest hit singles, a version of Marvin Gaye's \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\", featuring wife Carly on backing vocals and reached in America and in Canada. On the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart, the track also reached the top, and the follow-up single, the feelgood \"Mexico\", featuring a guest appearance by Crosby & Nash, also reached the Top 5 of that list. A well-received album, \"Gorilla\" showcased Taylor's electric, lighter side that was evident on \"Walking Man\". However, it was arguably a more consistent and fresher-sounding Taylor, with songs such as \"Mexico\", \"Wandering\" and \"Angry Blues\". It also featured a song about his daughter Sally, \"Sarah Maria\". \"Gorilla\" was followed in 1976 by \"In the Pocket\", Taylor's last studio album to be released under Warner Bros. Records. The album found him with many colleagues and friends, including Art Garfunkel, David Crosby, Bonnie Raitt, and Stevie Wonder (who co-wrote a song with Taylor and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### contributed a harmonica solo). A melodic album, it was highlighted with the single \"Shower the People\", an enduring song that hit on the Adult Contemporary chart and hit 22 on the Pop Charts. However, the album was not well received, reaching and being criticized, particularly by \"Rolling Stone\". Still, \"In The Pocket\" went on to be certified gold. With the close of Taylor's contract with Warner, in November, the label released \"Greatest Hits\", the album that comprised most of his best work between 1970 and 1976. With time, it became his best-selling album ever. It was certified 11\u00d7 Platinum in the US, earned a Diamond certification by the RIAA, and eventually sold close to 20 million copies worldwide.</s><s>Career.:1977\u20131981: Move to Columbia Records. In 1977 Taylor signed with Columbia Records. Between March and April, he quickly recorded his first album for the label. \"JT\", released that June, gave Taylor his best reviews since \"Sweet Baby James\", earning a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1978. Peter Herbst of \"Rolling Stone\" was particularly favorable to the album, of which he wrote in its August 11, 1977, issue, \"\"JT\" is####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done. That's not meant to criticize Taylor's earlier efforts.... But it's nice to hear him sounding so healthy.\" \"JT\" reached on the \"Billboard\" charts and sold more than 3 million copies in the United States alone. The album's Triple Platinum status ties it with \"Sweet Baby James\" as Taylor's all-time biggest-selling studio album. It was propelled by Jimmy Jones's and Otis Blackwell's \"Handy Man\", which hit on \"Billboard\"'s Adult Contemporary chart and reached on the Hot 100, earning Taylor another Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. The song also topped the Canadian charts. The success of the album propelled the release of two further singles; the up-tempo pop \"Your Smiling Face\", an enduring live favorite, reached the American Top 20; however, \"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\", which Danny Kortchmar wrote and composed for Taylor, did not enjoy much success, reaching only. Back in the forefront of popular music, Taylor guested with Paul Simon on Art Garfunkel's recording of Sam Cooke's \"Wonderful World\", which reached the Top 20 in the U.S. and topped####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the AC charts in early 1978. After briefly working on Broadway, he took a one-year break, reappearing in the summer of 1979, with the cover-studded Platinum album titled \"Flag\", featuring a Top 30 version of Gerry Goffin's and Carole King's \"Up on the Roof\". (Two selections from \"Flag\", \"Millworker\" and \"Brother Trucker\" were featured on the PBS production of the Broadway musical based on Studs Terkel's non-fiction book \"\", which Terkel himself hosted. Taylor himself appeared in that production as a trucker; he performed \"Brother Trucker\" in character.) Taylor also appeared on the No Nukes concert in Madison Square Garden, where he made a memorable live performance of \"Mockingbird\" with his wife Carly. The concert appeared on both the \"No Nukes\" album and film. On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an encounter with Mark David Chapman who would murder John Lennon just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010: \"The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested, and he was going to get in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John.\" The next night, Taylor, who lived in a building next-door to Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: \"I heard him shoot\u2014five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions.\" In March 1981, Taylor released the album \"Dad Loves His Work\" whose themes concerned his relationship with his father, the course his ancestors had taken, and the effect that he and Simon had on each other. The album was another Platinum success, reaching and providing Taylor's final real hit single in a duet with J. D. Souther, \"Her Town Too\", which reached on the Adult Contemporary chart and on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.</s><s>Career.:1981\u20131996: Troubled times and new beginnings. Simon announced her separation from Taylor in September 1981 saying, \"Our needs are different; it seem[s] impossible to stay together\" and their divorce finalized in 1983. Their breakup was highly publicized. At the time, Taylor was living on West End Avenue in Manhattan and on a methadone maintenance program to cure him of his drug addiction. Over the course of four months starting in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### September 1983, spurred on in part by the deaths of his friends John Belushi and Dennis Wilson and in part by the desire to be a better father to his children Sally and Ben, he discontinued methadone and overcame his heroin habit. Taylor had thoughts of retiring by the time he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. \"I had... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while\", he recalled in 1995: The song \"Only a Dream in Rio\" was written in tribute to that night, with lines like \"I was there that very day and my heart came back alive.\" The October 1985 album, \"That's Why I'm Here\", from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song \"Everyday\", released as a single reached. On the album track \"Only####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### One\", the backing vocals were performed by an all-star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley. Taylor's next albums were partially successful; in 1988, he released \"Never Die Young\", highlighted with the charting title track, and in 1991, the platinum \"New Moon Shine\" provided Taylor some popular songs with \"Copperline\" and \"(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' About That\", both hit singles on Adult Contemporary radio. In the late 1980s, he began touring regularly, especially on the summer amphitheater circuit. His later concerts feature songs spanning his career and are marked by the musicianship of his band and backup singers. The 1993 two-disc \"Live\" album captures this, with a highlight being Arnold McCuller's descants in the codas of \"Shower the People\" and \"I Will Follow\". He provided a guest voice to \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Deep Space Homer\", and also appeared later on in the series when the family put together a jigsaw puzzle with his face as the missing final piece. In 1995, Taylor performed the role of the Lord in \"Randy Newman's Faust\".</s><s>Career.:1997\u2013present: Comeback. In 1997, after six years since his last studio album####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, Taylor released \"Hourglass\", an introspective album that gave him the best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album had much of its focus on Taylor's troubled past and family. \"Jump Up Behind Me\" paid tribute to his father's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill. \"Enough To Be on Your Way\" was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade. The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker's divorce, which took place in 1996. \"Rolling Stone Magazine\" found that \"one of the themes of this record is disbelief\", while Taylor told the magazine that it was \"spirituals for agnostics\". Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and \"Hourglass\" was a commercial success, reaching on the \"Billboard\" 200 (Taylor's first Top 10 album in sixteen years) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on \"Little More Time With You\". The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since \"JT\", when he was honored with Best Pop Album in 1998. Flanked by two greatest hit releases, Taylor's Platinum-certified \"October Road\" appeared in 2002 to a receptive####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### audience. It featured a number of quiet instrumental accompaniments and passages. Overall, it found Taylor in a more peaceful frame of mind; rather than facing a crisis now, Taylor said in an interview that \"I thought I'd passed the midpoint of my life when I was 17.\" The album appeared in two versions, a single-disc version and a \"limited edition\" two-disc version which contained three extra songs including a duet with Mark Knopfler, \"Sailing to Philadelphia\", which also appeared on Knopfler's album by the same name. Also in 2002, Taylor teamed with bluegrass musician Alison Krauss in singing \"The Boxer\" at the Kennedy Center Honors Tribute to Paul Simon. They later recorded the Louvin Brothers duet, \"How's the World Treating You?\" In 2004, after he chose not to renew his record contract with Columbia/Sony, he released \"\" with distribution through Hallmark Cards. Always visibly active in environmental and liberal causes, in October 2004, Taylor joined the Vote for Change tour playing a series of concerts in American swing states. These concerts were organized by MoveOn.org with the goal of mobilizing people to vote for John Kerry and against George W. Bush in that year's presidential####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### campaign. Taylor's appearances were joint performances with the Dixie Chicks. Taylor performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Game 2 of the World Series in Boston on October 24, 2004, on October 25, 2007, both the anthem and \"America\" for the game on October 24, 2013, and Game 1 on October 23, 2018. He also performed at Game 1 of the 2008 NBA Finals in Boston on June 5, 2008, and at the NHL's Winter Classic game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Boston Bruins. In December 2004, he appeared as himself in an episode of \"The West Wing\" entitled \"A Change Is Gonna Come\". He sang Sam Cooke's classic \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" at an event honoring an artist played by Taylor's wife Caroline. Later on, he appeared on CMT's \"Crossroads\" alongside the Dixie Chicks. In early 2006, MusiCares honored Taylor with performances of his songs by an array of notable musicians. Before a performance by the Dixie Chicks, lead singer Natalie Maines acknowledged that he had always been one of their musical heroes and had, for them, lived up to their once-imagined reputation of him. They performed his song, \"Shower the People\",####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### with a surprise appearance by Arnold McCuller, who has sung backing vocals on Taylor's live tours and albums for many years. In the fall of 2006, Taylor released a repackaged and slightly different version of his Hallmark Christmas album, now entitled \"James Taylor at Christmas\", and distributed by Columbia/Sony. In 2006, Taylor performed Randy Newman's song \"Our Town\" for the Disney animated film \"Cars\". The song was nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for the Best Original Song. On January 1, 2007, Taylor headlined the inaugural concert at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York honoring newly sworn in Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer. Taylor's next album, \"One Man Band\" was released on CD and DVD in November 2007 on Starbucks' Hear Music Label, where he joined with Paul McCartney and Joni Mitchell. The introspective album grew out of a three-year tour of the United States and Europe called the One Man Band Tour, featuring some of Taylor's most beloved songs and anecdotes about their creative origins\u2014accompanied solely by the \"one man band\" of his longtime pianist/keyboardist, Larry Goldings. The mix of \"One Man Band\" won a TEC Award for best surround sound recording in 2008. On November####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 28\u201330, 2007, Taylor accompanied by his original band and Carole King, headlined a series of six shows at the Troubadour. The appearances marked the 50th anniversary of the venue, where Taylor, King and many others, such as Tom Waits, Neil Diamond, and Elton John, performed early in their music careers. Proceeds from the concert went to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council, MusiCares, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank, a member of America's Second Harvest, the nation's Food Bank Network. Parts of the performance shown on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in the December 23, 2007, broadcast showed Taylor alluding to his early drug problems by saying, \"I played here a number of times in the 70s, allegedly\". Taylor has used versions of this joke on other occasions, and it appears as part of his \"One Man Band\" DVD and tour performances. In December 2007, \"James Taylor at Christmas\" was nominated for a Grammy Award. In January 2008, Taylor recorded approximately 20 songs by others for a new album with a band including Luis Conte, Michael Landau, Lou Marini, Arnold McCuller, Jimmy Johnson, David Lasley, Walt Fowler, Andrea Zon####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####n, Kate Markowitz, Steve Gadd and Larry Goldings. The resulting live-in-studio album, named \"Covers\", was released in September 2008. The album forays into country and soul while being the latest proof that Taylor is a more versatile singer than his best-known hits might suggest. The Covers sessions stretched to include \"Oh What a Beautiful Morning\", from the musical Oklahoma!, a song that his grandmother had caught him singing over and over at the top of his lungs when he was seven years old. Meanwhile, in summer 2008, Taylor and this band toured 34 North American cities with a tour entitled James Taylor and His Band of Legends. An additional album, called \"Other Covers\", came out in April 2009, containing songs that were recorded during the same sessions as the original \"Covers\" but had not been put out to the full public yet. During October 19\u201321, 2008, Taylor performed a series of free concerts in five North Carolina cities in support of Barack Obama's presidential bid.

On September 8, 2009, Taylor made an appearance at the 24th-season premiere block party of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" on Chicago's Michigan Avenue. Taylor appeared briefly in the 2009 movie \"Funny People\", where he played \"Carolina in My Mind\" for a MySpace corporate event as the opening act for the main character. On January 1, 2010, Taylor sang the American national anthem at the NHL Winter Classic at Fenway Park, while Daniel Powter sang the Canadian national anthem. On March 7, 2010, Taylor sang the Beatles' \"In My Life\" in tribute to deceased artists at the 82nd Academy Awards. In March 2010, he commenced the Troubadour Reunion Tour with Carole King and members of his original band, including Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, and Danny Kortchmar. They played shows in Australia, New Zealand, Japan and North America with the final night being at the Honda Center, in Anaheim, California. The tour was a major commercial success and in some locations found Taylor playing arenas instead of his usual theaters or amphitheaters. Ticket sales amounted to over 700,000 and the tour grossed over $59\u00a0million.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### It was one of the most successful tours of the year. He appeared in 2011 in the ABC comedy \"Mr. Sunshine\" as the ex-husband of the character played by Allison Janney, and he performs a duet of sorts on Leon Russell's 1970 classic \"A Song for You\". On September 11, 2011, Taylor performed \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" in New York City at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum for the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. On November 22, 2011, Taylor performed \"Fire and Rain\" with Taylor Swift who was named after him, at the last concert of her Speak Now World Tour in Madison Square Garden. They also sang Swift's song, \"Fifteen\". Then, on July 2, 2012, Swift appeared as Taylor's special guest in a concert at Tanglewood. He was active in support of Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign and opened the 2012 Democratic National Convention singing three songs. He performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the President's second inauguration. He appeared on the final of \"Star Acad\u00e9mie\", the Quebec version of \"American Idol\", on April 13, 2009. On April 24, 2013, Taylor performed at the memorial service for slain MIT police officer Sean Collier who was killed by####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the men responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing. Taylor was accompanied by the MIT Symphony Orchestra and three MIT a cappella groups while performing his songs \"The Water is Wide\" and \"Shower the People\". On September 6 and 7, 2013, he performed with the Utah Symphony and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in the Thirtieth Anniversary O.C. Tanner Gift of Music Gala Concert at the Conference Center in Salt Lake City. He called the choir \"a national treasure\" In addition to the symphony and choir he was backed by some of his touring band pianist Charles Floyd, bassist Jimmy Johnson and percussionist Nick Halley. After a 45-year wait, James earned his first album on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart with \"Before This World\". The album which was released on June 16 through Concord Records, arrived on top the chart of July 4, 2015, more than 45 years after Taylor arrived on the list with \"Sweet Baby James\" (on the March 14, 1970, list). The album launched atop the \"Billboard\" 200 with 97,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending June 21, 2015, according to Nielsen Music.

In May 2020, James Taylor and Jackson Browne rescheduled their 2020 tour dates to 2021 due to the COVID-19 crisis. On November 24, 2020, the album was nominated for a Grammy in the category of \"Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album\". At the 63rd Grammy Awards, the album won the award, the first for James Taylor after being nominated in the same category in the 50th Grammy Awards in 2008 for James Taylor at Christmas.</s><s>Personal life.

Transitioning to the screen, his first major role was as a series regular on the NBC drama \"Persons Unknown\" (2010) and he landed his breakthrough performance as baseball player Jackie Robinson in the 2013 biographical film \"42\". He continued to portray historical figures, starring as singer James Brown in \"Get on Up\" (2014) and as a young Thurgood Marshall in \"Marshall\" (2017). Boseman achieved international fame for playing the Marvel Comics superhero Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) from 2016 to 2019. He appeared in four MCU films, including an eponymous 2018 film that earned him an NAACP Image Award####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. As the first black actor to headline an MCU film, he was also named in the 2018 \"Time\" 100. Boseman's final performance as the character in the Disney+ anthology series \"What If...?\" (2021) earned him a posthumous Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance. In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer. He kept his condition private, continuing to act until his death in 2020 from the illness. His final film, \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\", was released posthumously the same year to critical acclaim, earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama. Boseman also received four nominations at the 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards for his work in \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\", the most for a performer at a single ceremony, winning Male Actor in a Leading Role for the latter.</s><s>Early life and education. Chadwick Aaron Boseman was born and raised in Anderson, South Carolina, the son of Carolyn (\"n\u00e9e####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\" Mattress) and Leroy Boseman, both African-American. His mother was a nurse, and his father worked at a textile factory and managed an upholstery business. In his youth, Boseman practiced martial arts, and continued this training as an adult. As a child, he wanted to become an architect. According to Boseman, DNA testing indicated that some of his ancestors were Jola people from Guinea-Bissau, Krio people and Limba people from Sierra Leone, and Yoruba people from Nigeria. Boseman graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995, where he played on the basketball team. In his junior year, he wrote his first play, \"Crossroads\", and staged it at the school after a classmate was shot and killed. He competed in Speech and Debate in the National Speech and Debate Association at T. L. Hanna. He placed eighth in Original Oratory at the 1995 National Tournament. He was recruited to play basketball at college but chose the arts instead, attending college at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and graduating in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in directing. While at Howard, he worked in an African American\u2013oriented bookstore near the university, which friend Vanessa German####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### said was important and inspirational to him; he drew on his experience there for his play \"Hieroglyphic Graffiti\". His teachers at Howard included Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad, who became a mentor. Rashad helped raise funds, notably from her friend and prominent actor Denzel Washington, so that Boseman and other classmates could attend the Oxford Summer Program of the British American Drama Academy at Balliol College, Oxford, in England, to which they had been accepted. Boseman wanted to write and direct, and initially began studying acting to learn how to relate to actors. He attended the program in 1998, and he developed an appreciation for the playwriting of William Shakespeare; additionally, he studied the works of various dramatists, including Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. He also traveled to Africa for the first time while at college, working in Ghana with his professor Mike Malone \"to preserve and celebrate rituals with performances on a proscenium stage\"; he said it was \"one of the most significant learning experiences of [his] life\". After he returned to the U.S., he took additional course work in film studies, graduating from New York City's Digital Film Academy.</s><s>Career.</s><s>Career####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####.:2000\u20132007: Theater, \"Deep Azure\", and early television. Boseman lived in Brooklyn, New York City, at the start of his career. In 2000, he was named a Drama League Directing Fellow. He directed productions including George C. Wolfe's \"The Colored Museum\" (Wolfe would later direct Boseman in his final role) and a staging of Amiri Baraka's \"Dutchman\". He worked as the drama instructor in the Schomburg Junior Scholars Program, housed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem between 2002 and 2009. He rose to prominence as a playwright and stage actor in 2002, performing in multiple productions and winning an AUDELCO award in 2002 for his part in Ron Milner's \"Urban Transitions\". As a member of the National Shakespeare Company of New York, he played Romeo in \"Romeo and Juliet\" and Malcolm in \"Macbeth\". He directed and wrote plays as part of the Hip-hop theater movement; his works included \"Rhyme Deferred\" (co-written with Howard classmate Kamilah Forbes), in which he also performed, and \"Hieroglyphic Graffiti\". \"Rhyme Deferred\" was commissioned for####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a national tour, as well as featuring in \"The Fire This Time\" anthology of works, while \"Hieroglyphic Graffiti\" was produced at a variety of locations, including the National Black Theatre Festival in 2001. Combining modern African-American culture and Egyptian deities, it is set in Washington, D.C. and was picked up by the New York Hip-Hop Theatre Festival and Tennessee State University's summer stock theatre program in 2002. It was also the Kuntu Repertory Theatre's 2002\u201303 season launch production. At the 2002 Hip-Hop Theatre Festival, Boseman also gave a one-man show called \"Red Clay and Carved Concrete\". In 2003, Boseman was cast in his first television role, an episode of \"Third Watch\", and began playing Reggie Montgomery in the daytime soap opera \"All My Children\". He was fired from \"All My Children\" after voicing concerns to producers about racist stereotypes in the script; the role was subsequently re-cast, with Boseman's future \"Black Panther\" co-star Michael B. Jordan taking the part. Boseman had wanted to work around the stereotypes of the character, feeling that being in a soap opera would give him more room for improvisation as the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### writers often do not initially plan a full story; his (then-future) agent said that when Boseman was given the second script and learned that his character's parents were a drug addict and an absent father, Boseman confronted the creators. He reflected on the experience in his 2018 commencement address to Howard University, saying that it \"seemed to be wrapped up in assumptions about us as black folks [and he] would have to make something out of nothing.\" His other early television work included episodes of the series \"Law & Order\", \"Cold Case\", \"\", and \"ER\". Boseman's best-known play, \"Deep Azure\", was commissioned in 2004 by the Congo Square Theatre Company in Chicago. It was nominated for a 2006 Jeff Award for Best New Work. Boseman said at the time that \"Deep Azure\" was \"a fusion and progression of [his] previous plays\", which he did not feel fit wholly in the Hip Hop theater genre. The play \u2013 about police brutality, a daring subject in 2004, and largely delivered in rhyme \u2013 was workshopped at the Apollo Theater in New York. Drama critic Chris Jones in the \"Chicago Tribune\" highly praised the work. In 2008, Boseman turned \"Deep Azure\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### into a screenplay. Michael Greene, who would become his agent, picked it up and contacted Boseman when Tessa Thompson and Omari Hardwick expressed an interest in playing the lead roles, prompting Boseman's move to Los Angeles. He also directed, wrote, and produced the short film \"Blood Over a Broken Pawn\" in 2007, which was honored at the 2008 Hollywood Black Film Festival.</s><s>Career.:2008\u20132015: Breakthrough with \"42\" and \"Get on Up\". In 2008, Boseman moved to Los Angeles to pursue his film and acting career. He was cast in a recurring role on the television series \"Lincoln Heights\" as Nathaniel Ray Taylor, an army veteran with PTSD who was later revealed to be the son of the main character before re-enlisting. He also appeared in his first feature film in 2008, \"\", as running back Floyd Little. He landed his first regular role in the 2010 television series \"Persons Unknown\" as the Marine Graham McNair. The show received mediocre reviews that felt the characters were all archetypes with little development. In July 2013, Boseman's second short film as director, \"Heaven\", premiered at the HollyShorts Film Festival. Boseman's####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### breakthrough role came in 2013 with the film \"42\", in which he portrayed the lead role of baseball legend Jackie Robinson. Boseman had been directing an off-Broadway play in the East Village when he auditioned for the role, and was considering giving up acting to pursue directing full-time. About twenty-five other actors had been seriously considered for the role, but director Brian Helgeland liked Boseman's bravery in choosing to read the most difficult scene, in which Robinson goes down a stadium tunnel and breaks a bat in anger, and cast him after he had auditioned twice. Part of the audition process involved playing baseball; Boseman had been involved with Little League as a child but was primarily a basketball player growing up, saying that in this part the casting directors likely noticed his athleticism rather than specifically baseball skills. Robinson's widow, Rachel Robinson, commented that Boseman's performance was like seeing her husband again. To replicate Robinson's mannerisms, Boseman trained for five months with professional baseball coaches who \"would tape [his] practices every few weeks, and they would basically split-screen [his technique] with [Robinson's]\" to allow him to compare. After having portrayed football player Little in \"The Express\", Bose####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####man was encouraged by stunt coordinator Allan Graf to approach running bases in the same way, as Robinson had also been a college football player. Upon taking the role, Boseman first spoke with Rachel Robinson, which he said was of great help in discovering the character. The same year, Boseman also starred in the independent film \"The Kill Hole\", which was released in theaters a few weeks before \"42\". Critics, even those who viewed the film negatively, felt that Boseman being a relatively unknown actor was a benefit when playing an icon and an athlete; Mick LaSalle of \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote that \"as [...] played by Chadwick Boseman, Robinson is a hero we can recognize\", and Mary Pols for \"Time\" said that \"Boseman is not a hugely close physical match to Robinson, except for perhaps in the power he conveys, but he's a great choice to play the ball player\". \"The Guardian\" Mike McCahill noted that \"Boseman hits his key scenes out of the park\", but felt the film would not interest people who are not baseball fans, with Dana Stevens of \"Slate\" suggesting that the film made black history \"squeaky-clean\" and did both Robinson and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Boseman's performance as him a disservice. In 2014, Boseman starred in another sporting film, \"Draft Day\", as fictional football player Vontae Mack. He had workshopped the Tupac Shakur jukebox musical \"Holler If Ya Hear Me\" in 2013, but did not continue to Broadway with it in order to take the role of James Brown in 2014's \"Get on Up\". As Brown, Boseman did some singing and all of his own dancing, working with choreographer Aakomon Jones for five to eight hours a day over two months in preparation. Producer Mick Jagger also directed him on interacting with audiences when performing live music. He had not wanted to take a role in another biopic so soon after playing an icon in Robinson, saying he \"wasn't looking to do it again for another 15, 20 years\", but was sought out as director Tate Taylor's only choice. Co-star Dan Aykroyd, who had known Brown, praised Boseman's performance, saying that it was neither replication nor impression and that he \"did not have to squint sitting across from [Boseman] to imagine that [he] was talking to [Brown]\". Boseman also stayed in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### character between filming on set; Taylor said this was not a method acting approach, and more a necessity due to Boseman holding his vocal cords unnaturally to imitate Brown's southern drawl. His performance was praised as the highlight of a generally well received movie, with the Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reading: \"With an unforgettable Chadwick Boseman in the starring role, \"Get On Up\" offers the Godfather of Soul a fittingly dynamic homage.\" Among the critics was \"Time\" Richard Corliss (hyperbolically) saying that Boseman \"deserves a Pulitzer, a Nobel and instant election to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\" Eulogizing Boseman, Donald Clarke of \"The Irish Times\" said that \"\"Get on Up\" tested every weapon in the actor's arsenal [and his] performance confirmed that, like a star from Hollywood's golden age, Chadwick Boseman could do it all and do it all with style.\" Boseman had sold a thriller screenplay to Universal Pictures in 2014, which he continued to collaborate on with creative partner Logan Coles and planned to star in, and told \"The Guardian\" that he still wanted to be a director but would explore his acting career first, adding that \"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####maybe it'll be easier if you're a successful actor\". In 2016, he starred as Thoth, a deity from Egyptian mythology, in \"Gods of Egypt\". Boseman was one of the few actors of color featured in the film, which had drawn criticism for using a predominantly white cast to portray Egyptian characters. Agreeing with the criticism, Boseman said this had motivated him to accept the role, to ensure one of the film's African characters would be played by someone of African descent. Boseman's own casting was criticized for falling under the \"Magical Negro\" stereotype. \"The Independent\" reported that Boseman shook his head while telling \"GQ\" in an interview that \"people don't make $140 million movies starring black and brown people\". It was his first largely CGI film, and he expressed that he preferred acting alongside people than with blue screens and prop stand-ins. The film was heavily criticized; Jordan Hoffman for \"The Guardian\" said that it lacks story or interesting characters, but \"Boseman makes for nice comic relief as the witty Thoth\", with Will Leitch of \"The New Republic\" saying that his then-upcoming Marvel Studios role may have to work \"to make you forget he was ever####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in this movie\". Perri Nemiroff for \"Collider\" said that Boseman shines as \"the only cast member who really seems to understand the movie he's in\".</s><s>Career.:2016\u20132019: Marvel Cinematic Universe, \"Marshall\" and \"21 Bridges\". In 2016, Boseman began portraying the Marvel Comics character T'Challa / Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. \"\" was his first film in a five-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment. He did not audition for the role, instead having a \"discussion about what [Marvel] wanted to do and how [he] saw it and what [he] wanted to do.\" While working on \"Civil War\", Boseman learned some Xhosa from John Kani, who played his father, and insisted on using the language for the character. Boseman also developed a Wakandan accent himself, and used it during the entire production \"whether he was on camera or not\". When asked by journalist Ryan Gilbey if he felt pressure not to \"screw up\" the beloved comics character, Boseman responded by saying: \"It's more positive than that. It's more like: 'Seize it. Enjoy it.'\" He told the Associated####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Press, though, that he more identified with the Black Panther's nemesis, Killmonger, knowing that his roots to his African past had been severed. Producer Kevin Feige explained that the Black Panther was included in \"Civil War\" \"because [they] needed a third party. [It] needed fresh eyes [of a character] who wasn't embedded with the Avengers and who has a very different point of view than either Tony or Steve.\" Boseman's performance in \"Civil War\" was highly praised, though critics acknowledged the character's inclusion was largely to set up his upcoming headlining movie.Multiple sources: - - - - - - - Boseman returned as the Black Panther in \"Black Panther\" (2018), directed by Ryan Coogler, which focused on the character and his home country of Wakanda in Africa. The film opened to great anticipation, becoming one of the highest-grossing films. The role earned Boseman a spot on the 2018 \"Time\" 100 as one of the world's most influential people, with Sean Combs writing his entry. It is seen as a landmark in being the first mega-budget movie to have a predominantly black cast and director, as well as the first superhero film to be nominated for an####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Academy Award for Best Picture. The film was also critically well-received and Boseman was praised; Matthew Norman for the \"Evening Standard\" said that he \"brings a measure of sub-Shakespearean gravitas to T'Challa's struggle to bear the weight of his crown\"; Richard Lawson and \"Sight & Sound\" Kelli Weston also noted the strength of gravitas Boseman gave to the performance. Weston added that he, \"despite having the more thankless role [out of T'Challa and Killmonger], carries the film with a quiet dignity one might rightfully expect of a man raised to be king.\" Todd McCarthy and \"The Village Voice\" Kristen Yoonsoo Kim saw that while Boseman played his serious character well, the cast was full of charismatic scene stealers. Peter Travers gave much praise to Boseman as the lead, and said that he \"digs so deep into T'Challa that you can feel his nerve endings\"; LaSalle wrote that \"Boseman commands every moment of this film, radiating probity and purpose, and it's only later on that you realize that, with another actor, this wouldn't have been a sure thing.\" He reprised the role####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in both \"\" and \"\", which were released in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Both films were the highest grossing of the year they were released, with \"Endgame\" going on to become the highest-grossing film of all time. \"Infinity War\" was filmed at the same time as \"Black Panther\", and Boseman and other actors playing Wakandan characters improvised chanting scenes in the former that originated in the latter. Boseman's last physical appearance as Black Panther was in \"Endgame\", at Tony Stark's funeral; he voiced alternate versions of T'Challa in the 2021 Disney+ animated series \"What If...?\". Boseman portrayed Thurgood Marshall in the biographical film \"Marshall\" in 2017. Set years before he became the first African American Supreme Court Justice, the movie focuses on one of Marshall's early cases, the trial of Joseph Spell. It was premiered at Howard University, which both Boseman and Marshall had attended. Boseman was still worried about being put into a \"biopic box\", and felt that he didn't look enough like the real Marshall, but took the role because he enjoyed the script \"separate from the historical relevance\"; he had expected big courtroom speeches but found that in the case####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Marshall was silenced by the judge and had to mentor white co-counsel Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) to take on his first criminal case. He told \"The New York Times\" that he liked this element of the story because \"it doesn't allow you as an audience member, no matter what color you are, to hide from the issues\". Boseman researched Marshall extensively before portraying him, as well as studying videos of him speaking and losing muscle to reflect the younger Marshall's wiry frame. The film opened to an average critical reception, though Boseman's performance was praised. However, \"Vulture\" criticized his casting, noting that, unlike Boseman, \"the real-life Marshall was a light-skinned man, and his place on the color spectrum undoubtedly influenced how he became such a legend.\" Boseman had been concerned about their differences before taking the role, but was convinced by the director and producer that as the film was telling an insular story it did not matter as much. In 2019, he starred in \"21 Bridges\", an American action thriller film directed by Brian Kirk, as an NYPD detective who shuts down the eponymous twenty-one bridges of Manhattan to find two suspected cop killers. He was approached to work on the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### film by two of its producers, \"Avengers\" directors the Russo brothers, at the \"Infinity War\" premiere. While \"21 Bridges\" was filming, the Russos and Boseman were working on \"Endgame\". Boseman was also a producer on \"21 Bridges\", something he said was made clear to him in his early conversations with the production team; the three producers are given a nod in one of the film's opening lines, when a character is described as an \"avenger\". All of the film's characters were originally conceived as male and white, with Boseman encouraging amendments to this and other parts of the story. In his capacity as a producer, Boseman sought out Sienna Miller to be his co-star; Miller, who was intending to take a break from acting while her daughter was young, asked for a salary that the studio would not meet, and so Boseman donated the rest from his own pay. He also personally called Stephan James to ask him to play one of the criminals Boseman's detective is hunting; the two actors had been planning to work more together after the film. Boseman said that he and Coles \"fought for casting and for actors that brought particular sensibilities and feelings####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\". As an actor, Boseman developed his character by going on calls with the NYPD and LAPD, which he said influenced the writing after he fed back his experiences, and learning how to fire blanks and handle a gun with a police weapons specialist. While the film received mixed reviews, the cast was praised; Clarisse Loughrey of \"The Independent\" wrote that the film was indelicate in its storytelling, but that Boseman \"finds a surprising amount to work with in such a basic, stock character\", while the \"Los Angeles Times\" said that \"Chadwick Boseman and thin characters cannot keep \"21 Bridges\" from collapsing\". Glenn Kenny of \"RogerEbert.com\" was more positive towards the film, writing that \"it's no small feat to tie up an intelligent action thriller with such assuredness\" and that \"Boseman [...] does a lot of running and driving and gun-pointing and car-hood slamming here, but his character also does a lot of thinking \u2014 and a lot of maneuvering.\"</s><s>Career.:2020: \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\". In 2019 Boseman was announced as part of the cast for the Netflix films \"Da 5####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Bloods\", directed by Spike Lee, and \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\", directed by George C. Wolfe. He took these \"bucket-list roles\" for opportunities to work with Lee and with \"Ma Rainey\" producer Denzel Washington, as well as the opportunity to perform in an August Wilson play, telling \"Entertainment Weekly\" that he wanted to make these non-superhero films because \"if you don't do the films that you plan to do, I think you wouldn't feel fulfilled as an artist.\" He was also cast in a film telling the story of Yasuke, the only non-Asian samurai and the first black man in Japan, which he was set to co-produce; Boseman said: \"[the story is] not just an action movie, [it is] a cultural event, an exchange, and I am excited to be part of it.\" \"Time\" included Boseman on their list of the 10 Best Movie Performances of 2020, for both \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Ma Rainey\" for \"Ma Rainey\", Boseman received posthumous nominations in the Best Actor category at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, becoming the eighth person (and seventh man) to receive a posthumous Academy Award acting nomination. \"Da 5 Bloods\" was released on June 12, 2020. Lee, in choosing Boseman for the divine-like character of Stormin' Norman, said: \"This character is heroic; he's a superhero. Who do we cast? We cast Jackie Robinson, James Brown, Thurgood Marshall, and we cast T'Challa.\" Reception of his character was mostly positive; for the Associated Press, Jocelyn Noveck wrote that Boseman played Norman \"with movie-star charisma and classic war-movie grit\", and \"Empire\"s Kambole Campbell said his performance had \"regal charisma\", while Chuck Bowen of \"Slant\" said that he \"has a hauntingly gaunt presence, but he's already played too many saints.\" \"The A.V. Club\"s Ashley Ray-Harris felt the lack of digital de-aging for the other characters was unsuccessful in its aims and that \"Lee's script doesn't give Boseman much to do outside of this confused, Christ-like characterization and never exposes Norman's own na\u00efvet\u00e9.\" Conversely, Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" saw####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### it as a reflection that \"[he] has grown not old as those that are left grew old\", and a way to show how Norman has been romanticized in his comrades' memories; Odie Henderson of \"RogerEbert.com\" had a similar view and said that Boseman was \"a perfect casting move\", with the actor already carrying such a mythical status in black culture that he does not need to do much to be a believable mythical black icon as Norman. The film \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\", in which Boseman co-stars as trumpeter Levee, was released after the actor's death in 2020. Director Wolfe said that Boseman was excited by the role for the challenge it posed, saying that \"it's a \"monster\" role and it's a thrilling role, it's a difficult role. All of those things are exhilarating for an actor. And [Boseman] rose to the occasion and more than delivered.\" The film is based on the August Wilson play of the same name; Boseman was a fan of Wilson and wrote about him and his inspiration on Boseman's own work in a 2013 essay for the \"Los Angeles Times\". According to Chris Jones, Boseman's Levee####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### is \"an astonishing, revelatory performance and formidably distinct from the numerous interpretations seen on the stage\"; A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" similarly opined that \"it will be hard, from now on, to imagine [...] a Levee to compare with Boseman.\" Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n for \"Vulture\" wrote at length on Boseman's performance, saying that \"many of the important turns in the film hinge on Boseman's presence at the center. [...] In the first of his lachrymose monologues, Boseman is called to embody [anger and] gives the scene his all.\" Charlotte O'Sullivan of the \"Evening Standard\" said Boseman was brave to take on a \"more curdled\" role than the heroic leaders he is best known for, and that \"as skilful as he was talented, [he] hits the right notes, all the time.\" Clarisse Loughrey wrote that it was the actor's finest performance, that \"when [he] rages against an unjust God [...] it strikes like thunder\" and is \"delivered with such grace that there's a sense he had another hundred performances like it still in him.\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### In 2022, Boseman posthumously won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance for the \"What If...?\" episode What If... T'Challa Became a Star-Lord? at the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards.</s><s>Appraisal and legacy. According to film critic Owen Gleiberman of \"Variety\", \"Boseman was a virtuoso actor who had the rare ability to create a character from the outside in and the inside out [and he] knew how to fuse with a role, etching it in three dimensions [...] That's what made him an artist, and a movie star, too. Yet in \"Black Panther\", he also became that rare thing, a culture hero\". Similarly, reviewer Richard Brody in \"The New Yorker\" finds the originality of Boseman's formidable acting technique in his ability to empathize with the interior lives of his characters and render them on screen as fully and completely belonging to the character. He was uniquely able to capture and portray the dignity of his characters, according to \"The New York Times\" critic Wesley Morris. Well known for taking biopic roles, Hanna Flint for the BBC said he became the frequent choice because of his dedication to embodying character####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. Peter Bradshaw wrote of the actor's \"beauty, his grace, his style, his presence [...] These made up Chadwick Boseman's persona [and he became] the lost prince of American cinema[,] glorious and inspirational\". Culture writer Steve Rose, in \"The Guardian\", said that Boseman's career was revolutionary and he \"leaves behind a gamechanging legacy\", attributing this to the actor's careful planning and selection of roles. Eulogizing him, Rose wrote: As the Black Panther, Boseman led a predominantly black cast in a major blockbuster for the first time; \"Variety\" said that \"the significance of Chadwick Boseman [...] to the African American and Black community is immeasurable.\" Further expressing the weight of Boseman's legacy, Robert Daniels wrote for \"Vulture\" that \"his performance [as T'Challa] wouldn't just be a demonstration of craft [...] It'd become a piece of history. He'd face a slew of pressures, because a Black epic, even a period piece, is forever expected to be \"important\", representative of the past, present, and future.\" He told BBC Culture that \"through his acting, [Boseman] wrote, rewrote####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, and reclaimed black history\". Boseman's \"Ma Rainey\" co-star Viola Davis told Rose that \"he is going to be remembered as a hero\", both as the Black Panther and for the authentic man he was, and that \"his legacy, his body of work, his integrity, is going to influence on generations upon generations to come.\" BBC Culture called him \"a film icon who changed Hollywood\"; \"a symbol of black excellence and of cinematic excellence\"; and \"a virtuoso and heroic figure, not just because of his iconic turn as Marvel's Black Panther but for how he raised the bar for racial equality and representation on screen.\" Rhea Combs, film curator of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, said that with his screen presence, Boseman \"was not only a conduit to the past and the way African-Americans persevered and pushed through so many challenges, he also represented brightness and the promise of tomorrow\". The BBC also noted his impact of infusing African authenticity into his work, including his motivations for taking a role in \"Gods of Egypt\" as well as how T'Challa is presented, saying that he \"connect[s] African-American audiences with their African heritage\".

Boseman began dating singer Taylor Simone Ledward in 2015. The two reportedly got engaged by October 2019, and they later married in secret, as revealed by Boseman's family in a statement announcing his death. Boseman was raised a Christian and was baptized. He was part of a church choir and youth group and his former pastor said that he still kept his faith. He studied Hebrew and had a good knowledge of both the Old Testament and New Testament. Boseman had stated that he prayed to be the Black Panther before he was cast as the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</s><s>Personal life.:Philanthropy. Outside of performing, Boseman supported various charities. He worked with cancer charities including St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, continuing to support those battling the disease up until his own death from it; in a message to a producer days before he died, Boseman inquired about sending gifts to childhood cancer patients. He donated $10,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of Harlem to provide free tickets for children who wanted to see \"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####Black Panther\"; he did this to support and promote the Black Panther Challenge started by a New Yorker to raise money for similar children across the country. In response, Disney donated $1million to the Boys & Girls Clubs to advance its STEM programs. Boseman advocated for children's charities, with the Jackie Robinson Foundation noting after his death that he helped with their youth outreach. When Disney planned to donate $400million to charitable causes, Boseman encouraged the move. In April 2020, he donated $4.2million in personal protective equipment to hospitals fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in black communities, starting his own Operation 42 challenge to encourage others to donate PPE.</s><s>Personal life.:Advocacy. In politics, Boseman supported the When We All Vote campaign, and his last tweet before his death was congratulating Kamala Harris on her selection as Joe Biden's vice-presidential nominee.</s><s>Illness and death. Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, which eventually progressed to stage IV before 2020. He never spoke publicly about his cancer diagnosis, and according to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", \"Only a handful of non-family members knew that Boseman was sick... with varying degrees of knowledge about the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### severity of [his] condition.\" During treatment, involving multiple surgeries and chemotherapy, he continued to work and completed production for several films, including \"Marshall\", \"Da 5 Bloods\", \"Ma Rainey\", and others.

Many fellow actors and other celebrities paid tribute to Boseman on social media following the announcement of his death, including a number of his Marvel Cinematic Universe co-stars. Marvel####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Studios president and CCO Kevin Feige called Boseman's death \"absolutely devastating\", writing: \"Each time he stepped on set, he radiated charisma and joy, and each time he appeared on screen, he created something truly indelible [...] Now he takes his place [as] an icon for the ages.\" Co-stars from Boseman's other films also paid tribute to him. His alma mater, Howard University, tweeted in reaction that \"his incredible talent will forever be immortalized through his characters and through his own personal journey from student to superhero\". On August 29, 2020, the day after Boseman died, the tweet in which his family announced his death on his Twitter account became the most-liked tweet in history, with over six\u00a0million likes in under 24 hours, and accumulating over seven\u00a0million by August 31, far displacing the previous record holder. His death was likened to other unexpected deaths of young black celebrities in 2020, particularly Kobe Bryant and Naya Rivera.Multiple sources: - - - - - - - - - -  The Associated Press and \"Clar\u00edn\" noted Rivera and Boseman as Hollywood's most impactful 2020 deaths. Major League Baseball and the Los Angeles Dodgers, the franchise for which Robinson####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### played when the team was at its former home of Brooklyn, New York, issued statements honoring Boseman, in light of his acclaimed portrayal of the player. Several publications noted Boseman died on the observance of Jackie Robinson Day, seven years after his having portrayed Robinson. Prior to the fifth game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA playoffs, Boseman was honored with a moment of silence, alongside Cliff Robinson and Lute Olson. When Lewis Hamilton, the only mixed-race driver in Formula One, claimed pole position in qualifying at the 2020 Belgian Grand Prix, he dedicated his lap to Boseman, as well as his race win the following day.</s><s>Illness and death.:Tributes. On August 28, 2020, a Change.org petition was started, seeking to replace a Confederate monument in his hometown of Anderson with a statue of Boseman; it collected more than 50,000 signatures in less than a week, surpassing its original goal of 15,000 signatures. Henry McMaster, the Governor of South Carolina, ordered the Statehouse flags be lowered to half-staff on August 30 in honor of Boseman, who was born and raised in the state. ABC (which, like Marvel Entertainment, is####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### owned by Disney) aired a commercial-free version of \"Black Panther\", followed by a special about Boseman's life and work titled \"Chadwick Boseman \u2014 A Tribute for a King\" on the same day. Also aired on August 30 was the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards; the ceremony was dedicated to Boseman. On September 24, 2020, Disney unveiled a mural titled \"King Chad\", by artist Nikkolas Smith dedicated to Boseman at Downtown Disney in Anaheim, California.

Following his Best Actor win at the Academy Awards in April 2021, Anthony Hopkins said, \"I want to pay tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who was taken from us far too early, and again thank you all very much.\" Boseman is also memorialized in the 2020 video game \"\". The game includes an after-credits message dedicating it in memory of Boseman, as well as a street called Boseman Way on 42nd Street; the number 42 bears significance in the Miles Morales mythos as well as referring to Boseman's portrayal of Jackie Robinson. A####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Wakandan flag also appears. Amazon also made \"Black Panther\" comic titles available for free on its ComiXology platform in the wake of Boseman's death. On November 29, 2020, Marvel changed the studio's logo animation in the opening of \"Black Panther\" on Disney+ to include images of Boseman from the film, as well as his appearances in \"Captain America: Civil War\", \"Avengers: Infinity War\", and \"Avengers: Endgame\", to honor what would have been Boseman's 44th birthday. In a 2020 tribute, Ryan Coogler, the director of \"Black Panther\" and an upcoming 2022 sequel, offered condolences to Boseman's family and said that he had spent the last year \"preparing, imagining and writing words for him to say [in the sequel] that we weren't destined to see\". Coogler and Marvel Studios executives were unaware of Boseman's illness until his death. By the time of Boseman's death, Coogler was in the middle of writing the script and had already turned in a draft. Also paying tribute, Feige confirmed that the role of T'Challa would not be recast. Producer Nate Moore said that Boseman####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"was such an integral part of that character for us, both as the character and as a person, that we could not conceive of a version with having someone else on set\". Co-writers Coogler and Joe Robert Cole reworked the script following Boseman's death. The sequel, \"\" (2022), depicts T'Challa's death from illness and Wakandans processing the resultant grief; the Marvel Studios opening, usually featuring other MCU characters, only depicts the faint sound of wind and images of Boseman. The end credits featured the words \"Dedicated to our friend Chadwick Boseman\", and \"The Independent\" described \"Wakanda Forever\" as a \"soulful Chadwick Boseman tribute\". Coogler said that while the film was a tribute to Boseman, it was also a tribute to the resilience of the cast to \"honor Boseman\".</s><s>Awards and honors. - Boseman gave the commencement address at Howard University on May 12, 2018.</s><s>See also. - List of black Academy Award winners and nominees - List of posthumous Academy Award winners and nominees - List of black Golden Globe Award winners and nominees</s>", "Chadwick Boseman was an American actor, known for his portrayals of real-life historical figures such as Jackie Robinson in \"42,\" James Brown in \"Get on Up,\" and Thurgood Marshall in \"Marshall.\" He is perhaps best known for his role as T'Challa/Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starting with \"Captain America: Civil War\" and culminating in the highly successful \"Black Panther\" film in 2018.

In 1993, Dushku landed a role as Pearl, alongside Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, in the drama film \"This Boy's Life\". The following year, she played the teenage daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis in the action spy film \"True Lies\".

She also appeared in the spin-off series \"Angel\". As an unwelcome effect of her portrayal as Faith, Dushku was inundated with fan mail from prisoners. She said: I've been getting fan mail from maximum security penitentiaries and death row. What are the authorities thinking of in playing a show with young teenage girls to Death Row inmates? They write everything \u2013 disgusting things that you don't even want to know about.

Dushku became an honorary citizen of Tirana, and was given the honorary title of Tirana Ambassador of Culture and Tourism in the World by Tirana mayor Lulzim Basha. Additionally, she was given honorary citizen status in her father's home town of Kor\u00e7\u00eb.

In January 2018, Dushku made public an account of having been molested by stunt coordinator Joel Kramer when she was 12 and working on \"True Lies\". She wrote that soon after, an adult friend of Dushku confronted Kramer on set, and that the same day, Dushku was injured during a stunt and several of her ribs were broken, while Kramer was responsible for her safety. Kramer has denied the accusation of sexual misconduct. In January 2019, CBS made a $9.5 million settlement with Dushku after she was fired from a recurring role on \"Bull\", after informing producers of series lead Michael Weatherly's inappropriate behavior on the set. According to documents from the official mediation, Weatherly was recorded on video making####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### comments about spanking Dushku over his knee, soliciting a threesome, alluding to sexual assault in his \"rape van,\" and other inappropriate remarks. After Dushku spoke with producers, Weatherly texted CBS Television Studios' president David Stapf saying he wanted to talk about Dushku's sense of humor, though Stapf pushed back saying \"Ms. Dushku made the show better.\" Days later, showrunner Glenn Caron terminated Dushku's expected role on the show, despite opposition from studio executives. The settlement amount was calculated to compensate Dushku for her loss of earnings from her planned promotion to series regular, with \"well-developed plans\" set to make her a regular cast member following her three-episode guest appearance. In December 2018, when the settlement was reported, Weatherly publicly apologized for the comments. Dushku responded that Weatherly broke the terms of their settlement by speaking to the press and characterized his apology as \"more deflection, denial, and spin.\" In November 2021, Dushku testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee about her sexual harassment accusations during her time on \"Bull\". In February 2021, Dushku shared a message of support for Charisma Carpenter, in reference to allegations of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### abuse against \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon.</s><s>Personal life.:Health.

Moynahan made her feature-film debut in the 2000 comedy-drama \"Coyote Ugly\" as Rachel, a bartender and dancer in a wild New York bar, a role considered her breakthrough. She accepted the role because she \"thought it was interesting that the whole movie revolved around five women\u2026and my character was so strong and independent.\" The film received generally unfavorable reviews, but was a box-office success, earning $133\u00a0million worldwide.

Moynahan's next role was as a CIA trainee####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in \"The Recruit\" (2003).

In 2004, Moynahan worked alongside Will Smith in Alex Proyas' science-fiction movie \"I, Robot\", loosely based on Isaac Asimov's short-story collection of the same name. She portrayed Dr. Susan Calvin, a specialist in robot psychology. The film received mixed reviews, though critics enjoyed Moynahan's performance. Daniel Neman of \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" disliked the film, concluding that Moynahan \"turns in an able performance as Dr. Calvin, the convenient character.\" With revenue of $347\u00a0million worldwide, the film remains Moynahan's most commercially successful picture to date.

Moynahan's next film role was in the November 2006 thriller \"Unknown\", about a group of individuals kidnapped and trying to escape their captors together.

He was known for his romantic swashbuckler roles, frequent partnerships with Olivia de Havilland, and reputation for his womanising and hedonistic personal life. His most notable roles include the eponymous hero in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938), which was later named by the American Film Institute as the 18th greatest hero in American film history, the lead role in \"Captain Blood\" (1935), Major Geoffrey Vickers in \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1936), and the hero in a number of Westerns such as \"Dodge City\" (1939), \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940), and \"San Antonio\" (1945).</s><s>Early life. Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn was born on 20 June 1909 at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Battery Point, Tasmania. His father, Theodore Thomson Flynn, was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of biology at the University of Tasmania. His mother was born Lily Mary Young, but shortly after marrying Theodore at St John's Church of England, Birchgrove,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Sydney, on 23 January 1909, she changed her first name to Marelle. Flynn described his mother's family as \"seafaring folk\" and this appears to be where his lifelong interest in boats and the sea originated. Both of his parents were Australian-born of Irish, English and Scottish descent. Despite Flynn's claims, the evidence indicates that he was not descended from any of the \"Bounty\" mutineers. Flynn received his early schooling in Hobart. He attended The Hutchins School, Hobart College, The Friends School and Albura Street Primary School and was expelled from each one. He made one of his first appearances as a performer in 1918, aged nine, when he served as a page boy to Enid Lyons in a queen carnival. In her memoirs, Lyons recalled Flynn as \"a dashing figure\u2014a handsome boy of nine with a fearless, somewhat haughty expression, already showing that sang-froid for which he was later to become famous throughout the civilized world\". She further noted: \"Unfortunately Errol at the age of nine did not yet possess that magic for extracting money from the public which so distinguished his career as an actor. Our cause gained no apparent advantage from his presence in my entourage; we gained####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### only third place in a field of seven.\" From 1923 to 1925, Flynn attended the South West London College, a private boarding school in Barnes, London. In 1926, he returned to Australia to attend Sydney Church of England Grammar School (known as \"Shore\"), where he was the classmate of a future Australian prime minister, John Gorton. His formal education ended with his expulsion from Shore for theft, although he later claimed it was for a sexual encounter with the school's laundress. After being dismissed from a job as a junior clerk with a Sydney shipping company for pilfering petty cash, he went to Papua New Guinea at the age of eighteen, seeking his fortune in tobacco planting and gold mining in the Morobe Goldfield. He spent the next five years oscillating between New Guinea and Sydney. In January 1931, Flynn became engaged to Naomi Campbell-Dibbs, the youngest daughter of Robert and Emily Hamlyn (Brown) Campbell-Dibbs of Temora and Bowral, New South Wales. They did not marry.</s><s>Early career.</s><s>Early career.:\"In the Wake of the Bounty\". Australian filmmaker Charles Chauvel was making a film about the mutiny on the \"Bounty\", \"In the Wake of the Bounty####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\" (1933), a combination of dramatic re-enactments of the mutiny and a documentary on present-day Pitcairn Island. Chauvel was looking for someone to play the role of Fletcher Christian. There are different stories about the way Flynn was cast. According to one, Chauvel saw his picture in an article about a yacht wreck involving Flynn. The most popular account is that he was discovered by cast member John Warwick. The film was not a strong success at the box office, but Flynn's was the lead role, leading him to travel to Britain in late 1933 to pursue a career in acting.</s><s>Early career.:Britain. Flynn got work as an extra in a film, \"I Adore You\" (1933), produced by Irving Asher for Warner Bros. He soon secured a job with the Northampton Repertory Company at the town's Royal Theatre (now part of Royal & Derngate), where he worked and received his training as a professional actor for seven months. Northampton is home to an art-house cinema that was named after him, the Errol Flynn Filmhouse, from 2013 to 2019. He performed at the 1934 Malvern Festival and in Glasgow, and briefly in London's West End. In 1934 Flynn####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### was dismissed from Northampton Rep. after he threw a female stage manager down a stairwell. He returned to London. Asher cast him as the lead in \"Murder at Monte Carlo\", a \"quota quickie\" made by Warner Brothers at their Teddington Studios in Middlesex. The movie was not widely seen (it is a lost film) but Asher was enthusiastic about Flynn's performance and cabled Warner Bros in Hollywood, recommending him for a contract. Executives agreed and Flynn was sent to Los Angeles.</s><s>Hollywood. On the ship from London, Flynn met (and eventually married) Lili Damita, an actress five years his senior whose contacts proved invaluable when Flynn arrived in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. publicity described him as an \"Irish leading man of the London stage.\" His first appearance was a small role in \"The Case of the Curious Bride\" (1935). Flynn had two scenes, one as a corpse and one in flashback. His next part was slightly bigger, in \"Don't Bet on Blondes\" (1935), a B-picture screwball comedy.</s><s>Hollywood.:\"Captain Blood\". Warner Bros. was preparing a big budget swashbuckler, \"Captain Blood\" (19####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####35), based on the 1922 novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz. The studio originally intended to cast Robert Donat, but he turned down the part, afraid that his chronic asthma would make it impossible for him to perform the strenuous role. Warners considered a number of other actors, including Leslie Howard and James Cagney, and also conducted screen tests of those they had under contract, like Flynn. The tests were impressive and Warners finally cast Flynn in the lead, opposite 19-year-old Olivia de Havilland. The resulting film was a magnificent success for the studio and gave birth to two new Hollywood stars and an on-screen partnership that would encompass eight films over six years. The budget for \"Captain Blood\" was $1.242 million, and it made $1.357 million in the U.S. and $1.733 million overseas, meaning a huge profit for Warner Bros. Flynn had been selected to support Fredric March in \"Anthony Adverse\" (1936), but public response to \"Captain Blood\" was so enthusiastic that Warners instead reunited him with de Havilland and Curtiz in another adventure tale, this time set during the Crimean War, \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####1936). The film was given a slightly larger budget than \"Captain Blood\", at $1.33 million, and it had a much higher box-office gross, earning $1.454 million in the US and $1.928 million overseas, making it Warner Bros.' No. 1 hit of 1936. Flynn asked for a different kind of role and so when ill health made Leslie Howard drop out of the screen adaptation of Lloyd C. Douglas' inspirational novel, Flynn got the lead role in \"Green Light\" (1937), playing a doctor searching for a cure for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The studio then put him back into another swashbuckler, replacing Patric Knowles as Miles Hendon in \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (1937). He appeared opposite Kay Francis in \"Another Dawn\" (1937), a melodrama set in a mythical British desert colony. Warners then gave Flynn his first starring role in a modern comedy, \"The Perfect Specimen\" (1937), with Joan Blondell, under the direction of Curtiz. Meanwhile, Flynn published his first book, \"Beam Ends\" (1937), an autobiographical account of his experiences sailing around Australia as a youth. He also travelled to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Spain, in 1937, as a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War, in which he sympathised with the Republicans.</s><s>Hollywood.:\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\". Flynn followed this with his most famous movie, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938), playing the title role, opposite de Havilland's Marian. This movie was a global success. It was the 6th-top movie grosser of 1938. It was also the studio's first large-budget colour film using the three-strip Technicolor process. The budget for \"Robin Hood\" was the highest ever for a Warner Bros. production up to that point\u2014$2.47 million\u2014but it more than made back its costs and turned a huge profit as it grossed $2.343 million in the U.S. and $2.495 million overseas. It also received lavish praise from critics and became a world favourite; in 2019, Rotten Tomatoes summarised the critical consensus: \"Errol Flynn thrills as the legendary title character, and the film embodies the type of imaginative family adventure tailor-made for the silver screen\". In 1995, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. The scene in which Robin climbs to Marian's window to steal a few words and a kiss has become as familiar to audiences as the balcony scene in \"Romeo and Juliet\". Years later, in a 2005 interview, de Havilland described how, during the filming, she decided to tease Flynn, whose wife was on set and watching closely. De Havilland said, \"And so we had one kissing scene, which I looked forward to with great delight. I remember I blew every take, at least six in a row, maybe seven, maybe eight, and we had to kiss all over again. And Errol Flynn got really rather uncomfortable, and he had, if I may say so, a little trouble with his tights.\" The final duel between Robin and Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) is a classic, echoing the battle on the beach in \"Captain Blood\" where Flynn also kills Rathbone's character after a long demonstration of fine swordplay, in that case choreographed by Ralph Faulkner. According to Faulkner's student, Tex Allen, \"Faulkner had good material to work with. Veteran Basil Rathbone was a good fencer already, and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Flynn, though new to the school of fence, was athletic and a quick learner\". Under Faulkner's choreography Rathbone and Flynn made the swordplay look good. For the next two decades, Faulkner's movie credits as fencing double and choreographer reads as a history of Hollywood's golden years of adventure yarns, including Flynn's \"The Sea Hawk\" (1940). The success of \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" did little to convince the studio that their prize swashbuckler should be allowed to do other things, but Warners allowed Flynn to try a screwball comedy, \"Four's a Crowd\" (1938). Despite the presence of de Havilland and direction of Curtiz, it was not a success. \"The Sisters\" (1938) a drama showing the lives of three sisters in the years from 1904 to 1908, including a dramatic rendering of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, was more popular. Flynn played alcoholic sports reporter Frank Medlin, who sweeps Louise Elliott (Bette Davis) off her feet on a visit to Silver Bow, Montana. Their married life in San Francisco is difficult, and Frank sails to Singapore just hours before the catastrophe. The original ending of the film was the same as the book: Louise####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### married a character named William Benson but preview audiences disliked the ending and a new one was filmed in which Frank comes to Silver Bow to find her and they reconcile. Apparently audiences wanted Errol Flynn to get the girl, or vice versa. (Bette Davis preferred the original ending.) Flynn had a powerful dramatic role in \"The Dawn Patrol\" (1938), a remake of a pre-code 1930 drama of the same name about Royal Flying Corps fighter pilots in World War I and the devastating burden carried by officers who must send men out to die every morning. Flynn and co-stars Basil Rathbone and David Niven led a cast that was all male and predominantly British. Director Edmund Goulding's biographer Matthew Kennedy wrote: \"Everyone remembered a set filled with fraternal good cheer... The filming of \"Dawn Patrol\" was an unusual experience for everyone connected with it, and dissipated for all time the legend that Britishers are lacking in a sense of humor... The picture was made to the accompaniment of more ribbing than Hollywood has ever witnessed. The setting for all this horseplay was the beautiful English manners of the cutterups. The expressions of polite and pained shock on the faces of Niven, Flynn, Rathbone et al., when (women)####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### visitors were embarrassed was the best part of the nonsense\". In 1939, Flynn and de Havilland teamed up with Curtiz for \"Dodge City\" (1939), the first Western for both of them, set after the American Civil War. Flynn was worried that audiences would not accept him in Westerns but the film was Warner's most popular film of 1939 and he went on to make a number of movies in that genre.</s><s>Hollywood.:Second World War. Flynn was reunited with Davis, Curtiz and de Havilland in \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\" (1939), playing Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Flynn's relationship with Davis during filming was quarrelsome; Davis allegedly slapped him across the face far harder than necessary during one scene. Flynn attributed her anger to unrequited romantic interest, but according to others, Davis resented sharing equal billing with a man she considered incapable of playing any role beyond a dashing adventurer. \"He himself openly said, 'I don't know really anything about acting, she told an interviewer, \"and I admire his honesty, because he's absolutely right.\" Years later, however, de Havilland said that, during a private screening of \"Elizabeth and Essex\", an####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### astounded Davis had exclaimed, \"Damn it! The man \"could\" act!\" Warners put Flynn in another Western, \"Virginia City\" (1940), set near the end of the Civil War. Flynn played Union officer Kerry Bradford. In an article for TCM, Jeremy Arnold wrote: \"Ironically, the Randolph Scott role [as Captain Vance Irby, commandant of the prison camp where Bradford was a prisoner of war] was originally conceived for Flynn... In fact, \"Virginia City\" was plagued with script, production and personnel problems all along. Shooting began without a finished script, angering Flynn, who complained unsuccessfully to the studio about it. Flynn disliked the temperamental Curtiz and tried to have him removed from the film. Curtiz didn't like Flynn (or co-star Miriam Hopkins) either. Humphrey Bogart apparently didn't care for Flynn or Randolph Scott. Making matters worse was the steady rain that fell for two of the three weeks of location shooting near Flagstaff, Arizona. Flynn detested rain and was physically unwell for quite some time because of it. As Peter Valenti has written, \"Errol's frustration at the role can be easily understood: he changed from antagonist to protagonist, from Southern to Northern officer, almost####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### as the film was being shot. [This] intensified Errol's feelings of inadequacy as a performer and his contempt for studio operation\". Despite the troubles behind the scenes, the film was a huge success, making a profit of just under $1 million. Flynn's next film had been planned since 1936: another swashbuckler taken from a Sabatini novel, \"The Sea Hawk\" (1940) but only the title was used. A reviewer observed in Time 19 August 1940, \"\"The Sea Hawk\" (Warner) is 1940's lustiest assault on the double feature. It cost $1,700,000, exhibits Errol Flynn and 3,000 other cinemactors performing every imaginable feat of spectacular derring-do, and lasts two hours and seven minutes... Produced by Warner's Hal Wallis with a splendor that would set parsimonious Queen Bess's teeth on edge, constructed of the most tried-&-true cinema materials available, \"The Sea Hawk\" is a handsome, shipshape picture. To Irish Cinemactor Errol Flynn, it gives the best swashbuckling role he has had since Captain Blood. For Hungarian Director Michael Curtiz, who took Flynn from bit-player ranks to make \"Captain Blood####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\" and has made nine pictures with him since, it should prove a high point in their profitable relationship.\" It was indeed: \"The Sea Hawk\" made a profit of $977,000 on that budget of $1.7 million. Another financial success was the Western \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940), with de Havilland and Ronald Reagan and directed by Curtiz, which grossed $2,147,663 in the US, making it Warner Brothers' second-biggest hit of 1940. At the zenith of his career, Flynn was voted the fourteenth most popular star in the U.S. and the seventh most popular in Britain, according to \"Motion Picture Daily\". According to \"Variety\", he was the fourth-biggest star in the U.S. and the fourth-biggest box-office attraction overseas as well. Flynn consistently ranked among Warner Bros. top stars. In 1937, he was the studio's No. 1 star, ahead of Paul Muni and Bette Davis. In 1938, he was No. 3, just behind Davis and Muni. In 1939, he was No. 3 again, this time behind Davis and James Cagney. In 1940 and 1941, he was Warner Bros.'####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### No. 1 top box-office draw. In 1942, he was No. 2, behind Cagney. In 1943, he was No. 2, behind Humphrey Bogart. Warners allowed Flynn a change of pace from a long string of period pieces in a light hearted mystery, \"Footsteps in the Dark\" (1941). \"Los Angeles Times\"' Edwin Schallert wrote: \"Errol Flynn becomes a modern for a change in a whodunit film and the excursion proves eminently worth-while... an exceptionally clever and amusing exhibit...\" The film was not a big success; far more popular was the military drama \"Dive Bomber\" (1941), his last film with Curtiz. In later years, \"Footsteps in the Dark\" co-star Ralph Bellamy recalled Flynn at this time as \"a darling. Couldn't or wouldn't take himself seriously. And he drank like there was no tomorrow. Had a bum ticker from the malaria he'd picked up in Australia. Also a spot of TB. Tried to enlist but flunked his medical, so he drank some more. Knew he wouldn't live into old age. He really had a ball in \"Footsteps in the Dark\". He was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### so glad to be out of swashbucklers\". Flynn became a naturalised American citizen on 14 August 1942. With the United States fully involved in the Second World War, he attempted to enlist in the armed services but failed the physical exam due to recurrent malaria (contracted in New Guinea), a heart murmur, various venereal diseases and latent pulmonary tuberculosis. Flynn was mocked by reporters and critics as a \"draft dodger\" but the studio refused to admit that their star, promoted for his physical beauty and athleticism, had been disqualified due to health problems. Flynn started a new long-term relationship with a director when he teamed with Raoul Walsh in \"They Died with Their Boots On\" (1942), a biopic of George Armstrong Custer. De Havilland was his co-star in this, the last of 8 films they made together. The movie grossed $2.55 million in the U.S. alone, making it Warner Bros.' second-biggest hit of 1942. Flynn's first World War II film was \"Desperate Journey\" (1942), directed by Walsh, in which he played an Australian for the first time. It was another big hit. The role of Gentleman Jim Corbett in Walsh's \"Gentle####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####man Jim\" (1942) was one of Flynn's favourites. Warner Bros. purchased the rights to make a film of Corbett's life from his widow, Vera, specifically for their handsome, athletic and charming leading man. The movie bears little resemblance to the boxer's life, but the story was a crowd pleaser. Despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014its departure from reality, \"Gentleman Jim\" packed the theatres. According to Variety, it was the third Errol Flynn movie to gross at least $2 million for Warner Bros. in 1942. Flynn eagerly undertook extensive boxing training for this film, working with Buster Wiles and Mushy Callahan. Callahan's remembrances were documented in Charles Higham's \"\". \"Errol tended to use his right fist. I had to teach him to use his left and to move very fast on his feet...Luckily he had excellent footwork, he was dodgy, he could duck faster than anybody I saw. And by the time I was through with him, he'd jab, jab, jab with his left like a veteran\". Flynn took the role seriously, and was rarely doubled during the boxing sequences. In \"The Two Lives of Errol Flynn\" by Michael Freedland, Alexis Smith####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### told of taking the star aside: \"'It's so silly, working all day and then playing all night and dissipating yourself. Don't you want to live a long life?' Errol was his usually apparently unconcerned self: 'I'm only interested in this half,' he told her. 'I don't care for the future. Flynn collapsed on set on 15 July 1942, while filming a boxing scene with Ward Bond. Filming was shut down while he recovered; he returned a week later. In his autobiography, \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\", Flynn describes the episode as a mild heart attack. In September 1942, Warners announced that Flynn had signed a new contract with the studio for four films a year, one of which he would also produce. In \"Edge of Darkness\" (1943), set in Nazi-occupied Norway, Flynn played a Norwegian resistance fighter, a role originally intended for Edward G. Robinson. Director Lewis Milestone later recalled, \"Flynn kept underrating himself. If you wanted to embarrass him, all you had to do was to tell him how great he was in a scene he'd just finished playing: He'd blush like a young girl and muttering 'I'm no actor' would go away somewhere and sit down\". With####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a box office gross of $2.3 million in the U.S, it was Warner Bros.' eighth biggest movie of the year. In Warners' all-star musical comedy fund-raiser for the Stage Door Canteen, \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" (1943), Flynn sings and dances as a cockney seaman boasting to his pub mates of how he's won the war in \"That's What You Jolly Well Get\", the only musical number that was ever performed by Flynn on screen.</s><s>Hollywood.:Statutory rape charges. In late 1942, two 17-year-old girls, Betty Hansen and Peggy Satterlee, separately accused Flynn of statutory rape at the Bel Air home of Flynn's friend Frederick McEvoy, and on board Flynn's yacht \"Sirocco\", respectively. The scandal received immense press attention. Many of Flynn's fans founded organisations to publicly protest the accusation. One such group, the American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn\u2014ABCDEF\u2014accumulated a substantial membership that included William F. Buckley Jr. The trial took place in late January and early February 1943. Flynn's attorney, Jerry Giesler, impugned the accusers' character and morals, and accused them####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of numerous indiscretions, including affairs with married men and, in Satterlee's case, an abortion (which was illegal at the time). He noted that the two girls, who said they did not know each other, filed their complaints within days of each other, although the episodes allegedly took place more than a year apart. He implied that the girls had cooperated with prosecutors in hopes of avoiding prosecution themselves. Flynn was acquitted, but the trial's widespread coverage and lurid overtones permanently damaged his carefully cultivated screen image as an idealised romantic leading player.</s><s>Hollywood.:After the trial. \"Northern Pursuit\" (1943), also with Walsh as director, was a war film set in Canada. He then made a film for his own production company, Thomson Productions, where he had a say in the choice of vehicle, director and cast, plus a portion of the profits. This picture had a modest gross of $1.5 million. \"Uncertain Glory\" (1944) was a war-time drama set in France with Flynn as a criminal who redeems himself but it was not a success and Thomson Productions made no more movies. In 1943, Flynn earned $175,000. With Walsh he made \"Objective, Burma!\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in 1944, released in 1945, a war film set during the Burma Campaign. Although popular, it was withdrawn in Britain after protests that the role played by British troops was not given sufficient credit. A Western, \"San Antonio\" (1945), was also very popular, grossing $3.553 million in the U.S. and was Warner Bros.' third-biggest hit of the year.</s><s>Hollywood.:Post-war career. Flynn tried comedy again with \"Never Say Goodbye\" (1946), a comedy of remarriage opposite Eleanor Parker, but it was not a success, grossing $1.77 million in the U.S. In 1946, Flynn published an adventure novel, \"Showdown\", and earned a reported $184,000 (). \"Cry Wolf\" (1947) was a thriller with Flynn in a seemingly more villainous role. It was a moderate success at the box office. He was in a melodrama, \"Escape Me Never\" (1947), filmed in early 1946 but not released until late 1947, which lost money. More popular was a Western with Walsh and Ann Sheridan, \"Silver River\" (1948). This was a hit, although its high cost meant it was not very profitable.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Flynn drank so heavily on the set that he was effectively disabled after noon, and a disgusted Walsh terminated their business relationship. Warners tried returning Flynn to swashbucklers and the result was \"Adventures of Don Juan\" (1948). The film was very successful in Europe, grossing $3.1 million, but less so in the U.S., with $1.9 million, and struggled to recoup its large budget. Still, it was Warner Bros.' 4th-biggest hit of the year. From this point on, Warner Bros. reduced the budgets of Flynn's films. In November 1947 Flynn signed a 15-year contract with Warner Bros. for $225,000 per film. His income totalled $214,000 that year, and $200,000 in 1948.</s><s>Hollywood.:Later Warner films. After a cameo in Warner Bros.' \"It's a Great Feeling\" (1949), Flynn was borrowed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in \"That Forsyte Woman\" (1949) which made $1.855 million in the U.S. and $1.842 million abroad which was the 11th-biggest hit of the year for MGM. He went on a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### three-month holiday then made two medium budget Westerns for Warners, \"Montana\" (1950), which made $2.1 million and was Warner Bros.' 5th-biggest movie of the year, and \"Rocky Mountain\" (1950), which made $1.7 million in the U.S. and was Warner Bros.' 9th-biggest movie of the year. He returned to MGM for \"Kim\" (1950), one of Flynn's most popular movies from this period, grossing $5.348 million ($2.896 million in the U.S. plus $2.452 million abroad) making it MGM's 5th-biggest movie of the year and 11th biggest overall for Hollywood. It was shot partly in India. On his way home he shot some scenes for a film he produced, \"Hello God\" (1951), directed by William Marshall; it was never released. For many years this was considered a lost film, but in 2013 a copy was discovered in the basement of the surrogate court of New York City. Two of seven cans of the movie had deteriorated beyond hope, but five survived and are at the George Eastman House film archive for restoration. Flynn wrote and co-produced his next film,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the low-budget \"Adventures of Captain Fabian\" (1951), directed by Marshall and shot in France. (Flynn wrote articles, novels and scripts but never had the discipline to turn it into a full time career.) Flynn wound up suing Marshall over both movies. For Warners he appeared in an adventure tale set in the Philippines, \"Mara Maru\" (1952). That studio released a documentary of a 1946 voyage he had taken on his yacht, \"Cruise of the Zaca\" (1952). In August 1951 he signed a one-picture deal to make a movie for Universal, in exchange for a percentage of the profits: this was \"Against All Flags\" (1952), a popular swashbuckler. In 1952 he was seriously ill with hepatitis resulting in liver damage. In England, he made another swashbuckler for Warners, \"The Master of Ballantrae\" (1953). After that Warners ended their contract with him and their association that had lasted for 18 years and 35 films.</s><s>Hollywood.:Europe. Flynn relocated his career to Europe. He made a swashbuckler in Italy, \"Crossed Swords\" (1954). This inspired him to produce a similar movie in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### that country, \"The Story of William Tell\" (1953), directed by Jack Cardiff with Flynn in the title role. The movie fell apart during production and ruined Flynn financially. Desperate for money, he accepted an offer from Herbert Wilcox to support Anna Neagle in a British musical, \"Lilacs in the Spring\" (1954). Also shot in Britain was \"The Dark Avenger\" (1955), for Allied Artists, in which Flynn played Edward, the Black Prince. Wilcox used him with Neagle again, in \"King's Rhapsody\" (1955), but it was not a success, ending plans for further Wilcox-Flynn collaborations. In 1956 he presented and sometimes performed in the television anthology series \"The Errol Flynn Theatre\" that was filmed in Britain.</s><s>Hollywood.:Hollywood comeback. Flynn received an offer to make his first Hollywood film in five years: \"Istanbul\" (1957), for Universal. He made a thriller shot in Cuba, \"The Big Boodle\" (1957), then had his best role in a long time in the blockbuster \"The Sun Also Rises\" (1957) for producer Darryl F. Zanuck which made $3 million in the U.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####S. Flynn's performance in the latter was well received and led to a series of roles where he played drunks. Warner Bros. cast him as John Barrymore in \"Too Much, Too Soon\" (1958), and Zanuck used him again in \"The Roots of Heaven\" which made $3 million (1958). He met with Stanley Kubrick to discuss a role in \"Lolita\", but nothing came of it. Flynn went to Cuba in late 1958 to film the self-produced B film \"Cuban Rebel Girls\", where he met Fidel Castro and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Cuban Revolution. He wrote a series of newspaper and magazine articles for the \"New York Journal American\" and other publications documenting his time in Cuba with Castro. Flynn was the only journalist who happened to be with Castro the night Batista fled the country and Castro learned of his victory in the revolution. Many of these pieces were lost until 2009, when they were rediscovered in a collection at the University of Texas at Austin's Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. He appeared in a short titled \"Cuban Story: The Truth About Fidel Castro Revolution\" (1959), his last-known work.</s><s>Personal life.</s><s>Personal life.:Lifestyle. Flynn####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### developed a reputation for womanising, hard drinking, chain smoking and, for a time in the 1940s, narcotics abuse. He was linked romantically with Lupe V\u00e9lez, Marlene Dietrich and Dolores del R\u00edo, among many others. Carole Lombard is said to have resisted his advances, but invited him to her extravagant parties. He was a regular attendee of William Randolph Hearst's equally lavish affairs at Hearst Castle, though he was once asked to leave after becoming excessively intoxicated. The expression \"in like Flynn\" is said to have been coined to refer to the supreme ease with which he reputedly seduced women, but its origin is disputed. Flynn was reportedly fond of the expression and later claimed that he wanted to call his memoir \"In Like Me\". (The publisher insisted on a more tasteful title, \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\".) Flynn had various mirrors and hiding places constructed inside his mansion, including an overhead trapdoor above a guest bedroom for surreptitious viewing. Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood toured the house as a prospective buyer in the 1970s, and reported, \"Errol had two-way mirrors... speaker systems in the ladies' room. Not for security. Just that he was an A####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-1 voyeur.\" In March 1955, the popular Hollywood gossip magazine \"Confidential\" ran a salacious article titled \"The Greatest Show in Town... Errol Flynn and His Two-Way Mirror!\" In her 1966 biography, actress Hedy Lamarr wrote, \"Many of the bathrooms have peepholes or ceilings with squares of opaque glass through which you can't see out but someone can see in.\" He had a Schnauzer dog named Arno, which was specially trained to protect him. They went together to premieres, parties, restaurants, and clubs until the dog's death in 1941. On June 15, 1938, Arno bit Bette Davis on the ankle in a scene where she struck Flynn.</s><s>Personal life.:Marriages and family. Flynn was married three times: to actress Lili Damita from 1935 until 1942 (one son, Sean Flynn); to Nora Eddington from 1943 to 1949 (two daughters, Deirdre and Rory); and to actress Patrice Wymore from 1950 until his death (one daughter, Arnella Roma). Errol is the grandfather to actor Sean Flynn (via Rory), who starred in the TV series \"Zoey 101\". While Flynn acknowledged his personal attraction to Olivia de Havilland,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### assertions by film historians that they were romantically involved during the filming of \"Robin Hood\" were denied by de Havilland. \"Yes, we did fall in love and I believe that this is evident in the screen chemistry between us\", she told an interviewer in 2009. \"But his circumstances [Flynn's marriage to Damita] at the time prevented the relationship going further. I have not talked about it a great deal but the relationship was not consummated. Chemistry was there though. It was there.\" After quitting Hollywood, Flynn lived with Wymore in Port Antonio, Jamaica in the early 1950s. He was largely responsible for developing tourism to this area and for a while owned the Titchfield Hotel which was decorated by the artist Olga Lehmann. He popularised trips down rivers on bamboo rafts. His only son, Sean (born 31 May 1941), was an actor and war correspondent. He and his colleague Dana Stone disappeared in Cambodia in April 1970 during the Vietnam War, while both were working as freelance photojournalists for \"Time\" magazine. Neither man's body has ever been found; it is generally assumed that they were killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in 1970 or 1971. After a decade-long search financed by his mother,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Sean was officially declared dead in 1984. Sean's life is recounted in the book \"Inherited Risk: Errol and Sean Flynn in Hollywood and Vietnam\".</s><s>Death. By 1959, Flynn's financial difficulties had become so serious that he flew on 9 October to Vancouver, British Columbia, to negotiate the lease of his yacht \"Zaca\" to the businessman George Caldough. As Caldough was driving Flynn and the 17-year-old actress Beverly Aadland, who had accompanied him on the trip, to the airport on 14 October for a Los Angeles\u2013bound flight, Flynn began complaining of severe pain in his back and legs. Caldough transported him to the residence of a doctor, Grant Gould, who noted that Flynn had considerable difficulty navigating the building's stairway. Gould, assuming that the pain was due to degenerative disc disease and spinal osteoarthritis, administered 50 milligrams of demerol intravenously. As Flynn's discomfort diminished, he \"reminisced at great length about his past experiences\" to those present. He refused a drink when offered it. Gould then performed a leg massage in the apartment's bedroom and advised Flynn to rest there before resuming his journey. Flynn responded that he felt \"ever so much better\". After####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 20\u00a0minutes Aadland checked on Flynn and discovered him unresponsive. Despite immediate emergency medical treatment from Gould and a swift transfer by ambulance to Vancouver General Hospital, he did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead that evening. The coroner's report and the death certificate noted the cause of death as myocardial infarction due to coronary thrombosis and coronary atherosclerosis, with fatty degeneration of liver and portal cirrhosis of the liver significant enough to be listed as contributing factors. Flynn was survived by both his parents. Flynn was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, a place he once remarked that he hated, with six bottles of his favourite whiskey.</s><s>Posthumous controversies. In a 1982 interview with \"Penthouse\" magazine, Ronald DeWolf, son of the author L. Ron Hubbard, said that his father's friendship with Flynn was so strong that Hubbard's family considered Flynn an adoptive father to DeWolf. He said that Flynn and his father engaged in illegal activities together, including drug smuggling and sexual acts with underage girls; but that Flynn never joined Scientology, Hubbard's religious group. Journalist George Seldes, who disliked Flynn intensely, wrote in his 1987 memoir that Flynn did not travel to Spain####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in 1937 to report on its civil war as announced, or to deliver cash, medicine, supplies and food for the Republican soldiers, as promised. His purpose, according to Seldes, was to perpetrate a hoax that he triggered by sending an \"apparently harmless\" telegram from Madrid to Paris. The following day, American newspapers published an erroneous report that Flynn had been killed at the Spanish front. \"The next day he left Spain\u00a0...\u00a0. There were no ambulances, no medical supplies, no food for the Spanish Republic, and not one cent of money. The war correspondents said bitterly that it was the cruelest hoax of the time,\" Seldes wrote. \"Flynn... had used a terrible war just to advertise one of his cheap movies.\"</s><s>Posthumous controversies.:Relationship with Beverly Aadland. In 1961, Beverly Aadland's mother, Florence, co-wrote \"The Big Love\" with Tedd Thomey, alleging that Flynn had been involved in a sexual relationship with her daughter, who was 15 when it began. The memoir was adapted in 1991 by Jay Presson Allen and her daughter Brooke Allen into a one-woman play, \"The Big Love\", which starred Tracey Ullman as Florence Aad####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####land in its New York premiere. In 1996, Beverly Aadland gave an interview to Britain's Channel 4 documentary series \"Secret Lives\" corroborating the sexual relationship, and claiming that the first time she and Flynn had sex, he \"forced himself\" on her. She also said she loved him and wished they had more time together. \"I was very lucky. He could have had any woman he wanted. Why it was me, I have no idea. Never will.\"</s><s>Posthumous controversies.:Charles Higham biography. In 1980, author Charles Higham wrote a highly controversial biography, \"Errol Flynn: The Untold Story\", alleging that Flynn was a fascist sympathiser who spied for the Nazis before and during the Second World War, and that he was bisexual and had multiple same-sex affairs. He claimed Flynn had arranged to have \"Dive Bomber\" filmed on location at the San Diego Naval Base for the benefit of Japanese military planners, who needed information on American warships and defence installations. Higham admitted that he had no evidence that Flynn was a German agent, but said he had \"pieced together a mosaic that proves that he is.\" Flynn's friend David Niven criticised Higham for his unfounded accusations. In his autobiography, \"Iron Eyes####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Cody: My Life As A Hollywood Indian\", Iron Eyes Cody also trashed Higham's book and described Flynn as \"super straight\". Subsequent Flynn biographers are critical of Higham's allegations, and have found no evidence to corroborate them. Lincoln Hurst reported that Flynn attempted to join the OSS in 1942 and was put under surveillance by the FBI, which uncovered no subversive activities. Tony Thomas and Buster Wiles accused Higham of altering FBI documents to substantiate his claims. In 1981, Flynn's daughters, Rory and Deirdre, hired Melvin Belli to sue Higham and his publisher Doubleday for libel. The suit was dismissed on the grounds that a deceased person cannot, by definition, be libelled. In 2000, Higham repeated his claim that Flynn had been a German agent, citing corroboration from Anne Lane, secretary to MI5 chief Sir Percy Sillitoe from 1946 to 1951 and the person responsible for maintaining Flynn's British intelligence service file. Higham acknowledged that he never saw the file itself and was unable to secure official confirmation of its existence.</s><s>Film portrayals. - The character of Alan Swann, portrayed by Peter O'Toole in the 1982 film \"My Favorite Year\", was based on Flynn. -####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Duncan Regehr portrayed Flynn in a 1985 American TV film \"\", loosely based on Flynn's autobiography of the same title. - The character of Neville Sinclair (played by Timothy Dalton) in the 1991 film \"The Rocketeer\" is based on Flynn; the character's Nazi affiliations are based on Charles Higham's uncorroborated claims in his book, \"Errol Flynn, the Untold Story\". - Guy Pearce played Errol Flynn in the 1993 Australian film \"Flynn\", which covers Flynn's youth and early manhood, ending before the start of his Hollywood career. - Jude Law portrayed Flynn in Martin Scorsese's 2004 film \"The Aviator\". - Kevin Kline played Flynn in a film about his final days, \"The Last of Robin Hood\", made in 2013. - Thomas Cocquerel portrayed Flynn in his early life as an adventurer in \"In Like Flynn\" (2018).</s><s>Other cultural references. - In the 1950 \"Warner Bros.\" Looney Tunes short \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\", the character Daffy Duck repeatedly references Errol Flynn, in one instance exclaiming after jumping out of a window to mount his horse and landing instead on the ground, \"Funny, that never happens####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to Errol Flynn.\" - The 1965 Marvel Comics character Fandral, a companion of the Norse God Thor and a member of the Warriors Three, was based on the likeness of Flynn by co-creator Stan Lee.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Osama bin Laden Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden (; 10 March 1957 \u2013 2 May 2011) was a Saudi Arabian-born militant and founder of the pan-Islamic militant organization. The group is designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, and various countries. Under bin Laden, al-Qaeda was responsible for the September 11 attacks in the United States and many other mass-casualty attacks worldwide. A member of the wealthy Bin Laden family, Osama bin Laden was born in Saudi Arabia. His father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire from Hadhramaut, Yemen, and the founder of the construction company, Saudi Binladin Group. His mother, Alia Ghanem, was from a secular middle-class family in Latakia, Syria. He studied at university in the country until 1979, when he joined Mujahideen forces in Pakistan fighting against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He helped to fund the Mujahideen by funneling arms, money, and fighters from the Arab world into Afghanistan, and gained popularity among many Arabs. In 1988, he formed al-Qaeda. He was banished from Saudi Arabia in 1992, lost####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### his Saudi citizenship in 1994, and shifted his base to Sudan until US pressure forced him to leave in 1996. After establishing a new base in Afghanistan, he declared a war against the United States, launching a series of bombings and related attacks. His involvement in the 1998 US embassy bombings landed him on the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) lists of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives and Most Wanted Terrorists. Bin Laden masterminded the September 11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people and led President George W. Bush to invade Afghanistan and launch the \"War on Terror\". He became the subject of a decade-long international manhunt, during which the FBI offered a $25million bounty on him. On 2 May 2011, he was killed by U.S. special operations forces at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A highly influential ideologue, Bin Laden was able to first acquire sympathizers in the Islamic World due to his status a war-hero of the Afghan Jihad and subsequent focus on attacking Western imperialism. His targeting of civilians and hostile activities against Western governments have made him a reviled figure in the Western World and Western culture, and his role in the September 11 attacks has made public opinion of him in the United States unequivocally negative.</s><s>Name.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### There is no universally accepted standard for transliterating Arabic words and Arabic names into English; however, bin Laden's name is most frequently rendered as \"Osama bin Laden\". The FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other US governmental agencies, have used either \"Usama bin Laden\" or \"Usama bin Ladin\". Less common renderings include \"Ussamah bin Ladin\" and, in the French-language media, \"Oussama ben Laden\". Other spellings include \"Binladen\" or, as used by his family in the West, \"Binladin\". The decapitalization of is based on the convention of leaving short prepositions, articles, and patronymics uncapitalized in surnames; the (patrynomic) means \"son of\". The spellings with \"o\" and \"e\" come from a Persian-influenced pronunciation also used in Afghanistan, where bin Laden spent many years. Osama bin Laden's full name, Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, means \"Osama, son of Mohammed, son of Awad, son of Laden\". \"Mohammed\" refers to bin Laden's father Mohammed bin Laden; \"Awad\" refers to his grandfather,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a Kindite Hadhrami tribesman; \"Laden\" refers not to bin Laden's great-grandfather, who was named Aboud, but to Aboud's father, Laden Ali al-Qahtani. The Arabic linguistic convention would be to refer to him as \"Osama\" or \"Osama bin Laden\", not \"bin Laden\" alone, as \"bin Laden\" is a patronymic, not a surname in the Western manner. According to bin Laden's son Omar bin Laden, the family's hereditary surname is \"al-Qahtani\" (), but bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Laden, never officially registered the name. Osama bin Laden had also assumed the \"Ab\u016b 'Abd\u0101ll\u0101h\" (\"father of Abdallah\"). His admirers have referred to him by several nicknames, including the \"Prince\" or \"Emir\" (), the \"Sheik\" (), the \"Jihadist Sheik\" or \"Sheik al-Mujahid\" (), \"Hajj\" (), and the \"Director\". The word () means \"lion\", earning him the nicknames \"Lion\" and \"Lion Sheik\".</s><s>Early life and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### education. Bin Laden was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a son of Yemeni Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a billionaire construction magnate with close ties to the Saudi royal family, and Mohammed bin Laden's tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then called Alia Ghanem). In a 1998 interview, bin Laden gave his birth date as 10 March 1957. Despite it being generally accepted that bin Laden was born in Riyadh, his birthplace was listed as Jeddah in the initial FBI and Interpol documents. Mohammed bin Laden divorced Hamida soon after Osama bin Laden was born. Mohammed recommended Hamida to Mohammed al-Attas, an associate. Al-Attas married Hamida in the late 1950s or early 1960s. The couple had four children, and bin Laden lived in the new household with three half-brothers and one half-sister. The bin Laden family made $5\u00a0billion in the construction industry, of which Osama later inherited around $25\u201330\u00a0million. Bin Laden was raised as a devout Sunni Muslim. From 1968 to 1976, he attended the elite Al-Thager Model School. He studied economics and business administration at King Abdulaziz University. Some reports suggest he earned a degree in civil engineering in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 1979, or a degree in public administration in 1981. Bin Laden attended an English-language course in Oxford, England, during 1971. One source described him as \"hard working\"; another said he left university during his third year without completing a college degree. At university, bin Laden's main interest was religion, where he was involved in both \"interpreting the Quran and jihad\" and charitable work. Other interests included writing poetry; reading, with the works of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and Charles de Gaulle said to be among his favorites; black stallions; and association football, in which he enjoyed playing at centre forward and followed the English club Arsenal.</s><s>Personal life. At age 17 in 1974, bin Laden married Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria; but they were later separated and she left Afghanistan on 9 September 2001. Bin Laden's other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1990s); Khairiah Sabar (married 1985); Siham Sabar (married 1987); and Amal al-Sadah (married 2000). Some sources also list a sixth wife, name unknown, whose marriage to bin Laden was annulled soon after the ceremony. Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children with his wives.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Many of bin Laden's children fled to Iran following the September 11 attacks and, Iranian authorities reportedly continue to control their movements. Nasser al-Bahri, who was bin Laden's personal bodyguard from 1997 to 2001, details bin Laden's personal life in his memoir. He describes him as a frugal man and strict father, who enjoyed taking his large family on shooting trips and picnics in the desert. Bin Laden's father Mohammed died in 1967 in an airplane crash in Saudi Arabia when his American pilot Jim Harrington misjudged a landing. Bin Laden's eldest half-brother, Salem bin Laden, the subsequent head of the bin Laden family, was killed in 1988 near San Antonio, Texas, in the United States, when he accidentally flew a plane into power lines. The FBI described bin Laden as an adult as tall and thin, between and in height and weighing about, although the author Lawrence Wright, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book on al-Qaeda, \"The Looming Tower\", writes that a number of bin Laden's close friends confirmed that reports of his height were greatly exaggerated, and that bin Laden was actually \"just over tall\". Eventually, after his death, he was measured to be roughly. Bin Laden had an olive complexion and was left####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-handed, usually walking with a cane. He wore a plain white keffiyeh. Bin Laden had stopped wearing the traditional Saudi male keffiyeh and instead wore the traditional Yemeni male keffiyeh. Bin Laden was described as soft-spoken and mild-mannered in demeanor.</s><s>Beliefs and ideology. A major component of bin Laden's ideology was the concept that civilians from enemy countries, including women and children, were legitimate targets for jihadists to kill. According to former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer, who led the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader was motivated by a belief that US foreign policy has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East. As such, the threat to US national security arises not from al-Qaeda being offended by what the US is but rather by what the US does, or in the words of Scheuer, \"They (al-Qaeda) hate us (Americans) for what we do, not who we are.\" Nonetheless, bin Laden criticized the US for its secular form of governance, calling upon Americans to convert to Islam and reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling, and usury, in a letter published####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in late 2002. Bin Laden believed that the Islamic world was in crisis and that the complete restoration of Sharia law would be the only way to set things right in the Muslim world. He opposed such alternatives as secular government, as well as pan-Arabism, socialism, communism, and democracy. He subscribed to the Athari (literalist) school of Islamic theology. These beliefs, in conjunction with violent jihad, have sometimes been called Qutbism after being promoted by Sayyid Qutb. Bin Laden believed that Afghanistan, under the rule of Mullah Omar's Taliban, was \"the only Islamic country\" in the Muslim world. Bin Laden consistently dwelt on the need for violent jihad to right what he believed were injustices against Muslims perpetrated by the United States and sometimes by other non-Muslim states. He also called for the elimination of Israel, and called upon the United States to withdraw all of its civilians and military personnel from the Middle East, as well as from every Islamic country of the world. His viewpoints and methods of achieving them had led to him being designated as a terrorist by scholars, journalists from \"The New York Times\", the BBC, and Qatari news station Al Jazeera, analysts such as Peter Bergen, Michael Scheuer, Marc####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Sageman, and Bruce Hoffman. He was indicted on terrorism charges by law enforcement agencies in Madrid, New York City, and Tripoli. In 1997, he condemned the United States for its hypocrisy in not labeling the bombing of Hiroshima as terrorism. In November 2001, he maintained that the revenge killing of Americans was justified because he claimed that Islamic law allows believers to attack invaders even when the enemy uses human shields. However, according to Rodenbeck, \"this classical position was originally intended as a legal justification for the accidental killings of civilians under very limited circumstances \u2014 not as a basis for the intentional targeting of noncombatants.\" A few months later in a 2002 letter, he made no mention of this justification but claimed \"that since the United States is a democracy, all citizens bear responsibility for its government's actions, and civilians are therefore fair targets.\" Bin Laden's overall strategy for achieving his goals against much larger enemies such as the Soviet Union and United States was to lure them into a long war of attrition in Muslim countries, attracting large numbers of jihadists who would never surrender. He believed this would lead to economic collapse of the enemy countries, by \"bleeding\" them dry. Al-Qaeda manuals express this strategy. In a 2004 tape broadcast by Al Jazeera, bin Laden spoke of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy\". A number of errors and inconsistencies in bin Laden's arguments have been alleged by authors such as Max Rodenbeck and Noah Feldman. He invoked democracy both as an example of the deceit and fraudulence of Western political system\u2014American law being \"the law of the rich and wealthy\"\u2014and as the reason civilians are responsible for their government's actions and so can be lawfully punished by death. He denounced democracy as a \"religion of ignorance\" that violates Islam by issuing man-made laws, but in a later statement compares the Western democracy of Spain favorably to the Muslim world in which the ruler is accountable. Rodenbeck states, \"Evidently, [bin Laden] has never heard theological justifications for democracy, based on the notion that the will of the people must necessarily reflect the will of an all-knowing God.\" Bin Laden was heavily anti-Semitic, stating that most of the negative events that occurred in the world were the direct result of Jewish actions. In a December 1998 interview with Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, bin Laden stated that Operation Desert Fox was proof that Israeli Jews controlled the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, directing them to kill as many Muslims as they could. In a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### letter released in late 2002, he stated that Jews controlled the civilian media outlets, politics, and economic institutions of the United States. In a May 1998 interview with ABC's John Miller, bin Laden stated that the Israeli state's ultimate goal was to annex the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East into its territory and enslave its peoples, as part of what he called a \"Greater Israel\". He stated that Jews and Muslims could never get along and that war was \"inevitable\" between them, and further accused the US of stirring up anti-Islamic sentiment. He claimed that the US State Department and US Department of Defense were controlled by Jews, for the sole purpose of serving the Israeli state's goals. He often delivered warnings against alleged Jewish conspiracies: \"These Jews are masters of usury and leaders in treachery. They will leave you nothing, either in this world or the next.\" Shia Muslims have been listed along with heretics, the United States, and Israel as the four principal enemies of Islam at ideology classes of bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization. Bin Laden was opposed to music on religious grounds, and his attitude towards technology was mixed. He was interested in earth-moving machinery and genetic engineering of plants on the one hand, but rejected chilled water on####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the other. Bin Laden also believed climate change to be a serious threat and penned a letter urging Americans to work with President Barack Obama to make a rational decision to \"save humanity from the harmful gases that threaten its destiny\".</s><s>Militant and political career.</s><s>Militant and political career.:Mujahideen in Afghanistan. After leaving college in 1979, bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the Mujahideen resistance in the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. He later told a journalist: \"I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.\" From 1979 to 1992, the United States (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Arabia, and China provided between $6\u201312 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to tens of thousands of mujahideen through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). British journalist Jason Burke wrote: \"He did not receive any direct funding or training from the US during the 1980s. Nor did his followers. The Afghan mujahideen, via Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency, received large amounts of both. Some bled to the Arabs fighting the Soviets but nothing significant.\"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agency. Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the ISI. According to some CIA officers, beginning in early 1980, bin Laden acted as a liaison between the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency (GIP) and Afghan warlords; no evidence of contact between the CIA and Bin Laden exists in the CIA archives. Steve Coll states that although bin Laden may not have been a formal, salaried GIP agent, \"it seems clear that bin Laden did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence.\" Bin Laden's first trainer was U.S. Special Forces commando Ali Mohamed. By 1984, bin Laden and Azzam established Maktab al-Khidamat, which funneled money, arms, and fighters from around the Arab world into Afghanistan. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's inherited family fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation, paid for paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihadi fighters. Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained volunteers from across the Muslim world to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Between 1986 and 1987, bin Laden set up a base in eastern Afghanistan for several dozen of his own Arab soldiers. From this base, bin Laden participated in some combat activity against the Soviets, such as the Battle of Jaji in 1987. Despite its little strategic significance, the battle was lionized in the mainstream Arab press. It was during this time that he became idolised by many Arabs.</s><s>Militant and political career.:1988 Gilgit massacre. In May 1988, responding to rumours of a massacre of Sunnis by Shias, large numbers of Shias from in and around Gilgit, Pakistan were killed in a massacre. Shia civilians were also subjected to rape. The massacre is alleged by B. Raman, a founder of India's Research and Analysis Wing, to have been in response to a revolt by the Shias of Gilgit during the rule of military dictator Zia-ul Haq. He alleged that the Pakistan Army induced Osama bin Laden to lead an armed group of Sunni tribals, from Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier Province, into Gilgit and its surrounding areas to suppress the revolt.</s><s>Militant and political career.:Formation and structuring of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### al-Qaeda. By 1988, bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat. While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, bin Laden wanted a more military role. One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force. Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on 20 August 1988, indicate that al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: \"Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make his religion victorious.\" A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (\"bayat\") to follow one's superiors. According to Wright, the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because its existence was still a closely held secret. His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an 11 August 1988, meeting between several senior leaders of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Abdullah Azzam, and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan. Following####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, Osama bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia as a hero of jihad. Along with his Arab legion, he was thought to have brought down the mighty superpower of the Soviet Union. After his return to Saudi Arabia, bin Laden engaged in opposition movements to the Saudi monarchy while working for his family business. He offered to send al-Qaeda to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Yemeni Socialist Party government in South Yemen but was rebuffed by Prince Turki bin Faisal. He then tried to disrupt the Yemeni unification process by assassinating YSP leaders but was halted by Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz after President Ali Abdullah Saleh complained to King Fahd. He was also angered by the internecine tribal fighting among the Afghans. However, he continued working with the Saudi GID and the Pakistani ISI. He funded the 1990 Afghan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt and also lobbied the Parliament of Pakistan to carry out an unsuccessful motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait under Saddam Hussein on 2 August 1990, put the Saudi kingdom and the royal family at risk. With Iraqi forces on the Saudi border, Saddam's appeal to pan-Arabism was potentially inciting internal dissent.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### One week after King Fahd agreed to U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney's offer of American military assistance, Bin Laden met with King Fahd and Saudi Defense Minister Sultan, telling them not to depend on non-Muslim assistance from the United States and others and offering to help defend Saudi Arabia with his Arab legion. When Sultan asked how bin Laden would defend the fighters if Saddam used Iraqi chemical and biological weapons against them he replied \"We will fight him with faith.\" Bin Laden's offer was rebuffed, and the Saudi monarchy invited the deployment of U.S. forces in Saudi territory. Bin Laden publicly denounced Saudi dependence on the U.S. forces, arguing that the Quran prohibited non-Muslims from setting foot in the Arabian Peninsula and that two holiest shrines of Islam, Mecca and Medina, the cities in which the prophet Muhammad received and recited Allah's message, should only be defended by Muslims. Bin Laden tried to convince the Saudi \"ulama\" to issue a fatwa condemning the American military deployment but senior clerics refused out of fear of repression. Bin Laden's criticism of the Saudi monarchy led them to try to silence him. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division landed in the north-eastern Saudi city of Dhahran and was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### deployed in the desert barely 400 miles from Medina. Meanwhile, on 8 November 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of El Sayyid Nosair, an associate of al-Qaeda operative Ali Mohamed. They discovered copious evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers. This marked the earliest discovery of al-Qaeda terrorist plans outside of Muslim countries. Nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and later admitted guilt for the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York City on 5 November 1990.</s><s>Militant and political career.:Move to Sudan. In 1991, bin Laden was expelled from Saudi Arabia by its government after repeatedly criticizing the Saudi alliance with the United States. He and his followers moved first to Afghanistan and then relocated to Sudan by 1992, in a deal brokered by Ali Mohamed. Bin Laden's personal security detail consisted of bodyguards personally selected by him. Their arsenal included SA-7, Stinger missiles, AK-47s, RPGs, and PK machine guns. Meanwhile, in March\u2013April 1992, bin Laden tried to play a pacifying role in the escalating civil war in Afghanistan, by urging warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to join the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### other mujahideen leaders negotiating a coalition government instead of trying to conquer Kabul for himself. US intelligence monitored bin Laden in Sudan using operatives to run by daily and to photograph activities at his compound, and using an intelligence safe house and signals intelligence to surveil him and to record his moves.</s><s>Militant and political career.:Sudan and return to Afghanistan. In Sudan, bin Laden established a new base for Mujahideen operations in Khartoum. He bought a house on Al-Mashtal Street in the affluent Al-Riyadh quarter and a retreat at Soba on the Blue Nile. During his time in Sudan, he heavily invested in the infrastructure, in agriculture and businesses. He was the Sudan agent for the British firm Hunting Surveys, and built roads using the same bulldozers he had employed to construct mountain tracks in Afghanistan. Many of his labourers were the same fighters who had been his comrades in the war against the Soviet Union. He was generous to the poor and popular with the people. He continued to criticize King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. In response, in 1994 Fahd stripped bin Laden of his Saudi citizenship and persuaded his family to cut off his $7\u00a0million a year stipend. By that time####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, bin Laden was being linked with Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), which made up the core of al-Qaeda. In 1995 the EIJ attempted to assassinate the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The attempt failed, and Sudan expelled the EIJ. The US State Department accused Sudan of being a sponsor of international terrorism and bin Laden of operating terrorist training camps in the Sudanese desert. However, according to Sudan officials, this stance became obsolete as the Islamist political leader Hassan al-Turabi lost influence in their country. The Sudanese wanted to engage with the US but American officials refused to meet with them even after they had expelled bin Laden. It was not until 2000 that the State Department authorized US intelligence officials to visit Sudan. The 9/11 Commission Report states: In late 1995, when Bin Laden was still in Sudan, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) learned that Sudanese officials were discussing with the Saudi government the possibility of expelling Bin Laden. CIA paramilitary officer Billy Waugh tracked down Bin Ladin in Sudan and prepared an operation to apprehend him, but was denied authorization. US Ambassador Timothy Carney encouraged the Sudanese to pursue this course. The Saudis, however, did not want Bin Laden, giving as their reason their revocation of his citizenship.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Laden over to the United States. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Laden. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding against bin Laden in any country. The 9/11 Commission Report further states: In February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the United States and other governments, asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure. In secret meetings with Saudi officials, Sudan offered to expel Bin Laden to Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudis to pardon him. US officials became aware of these secret discussions, certainly by March. Saudi officials apparently wanted Bin Laden expelled from Sudan. They had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate his presence in their country. Also Bin Laden may have no longer felt safe in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one assassination attempt that he believed to have been the work of the Egyptian or Saudi regimes, and paid for by the CIA. Due to the increasing pressure on Sudan from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United States, bin Laden was permitted to leave####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### for a country of his choice. He chose to return to Jalalabad, Afghanistan aboard a chartered flight on 18 May 1996; there he forged a close relationship with Mullah Mohammed Omar. According to the 9/11 Commission, the expulsion from Sudan significantly weakened bin Laden and his organization. Some African intelligence sources have argued that the expulsion left bin Laden without an option other than becoming a full-time radical, and that most of the 300 Afghan Arabs who left with him subsequently became terrorists. Various sources report that bin Laden lost between $20\u00a0million and $300\u00a0million in Sudan; the government seized his construction equipment, and bin Laden was forced to liquidate his businesses, land, and even his horses.</s><s>Militant and political career.:Sudan and return to Afghanistan.:1996 Declaration of war and 1998 fatwa. In August 1996, bin Laden issued a fatwa titled \"\"Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places\"\" which was published by \"Al-Quds Al-Arabi\", a London-based newspaper. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called \"The Land of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest places in Islam. The reference to occupation in the \"fat####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####w\u0101\" referred to US forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as Operation Southern Watch. Despite the assurance of President George H. W. Bush to King Fahd in 1990, that all US forces based in Saudi Arabia would be withdrawn once the Iraqi threat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans were still there. Bush cited the necessity of dealing with the remnants of Saddam's regime (which Bush had chosen not to destroy). Bin Laden's view was that \"the 'evils' of the Middle East arose from America's attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel. Saudi Arabia had been turned into an American colony\". Fervently attacking American support for Israel and Saudi Arabia as well as its sanctions on Iraq, Bin Laden declared in the \"fatwa\": \"Terrorising you, while you are carrying arms on our land, is a legitimate and morally demanded duty. It is a legitimate right well known to all humans and other creatures... [our] youths are different from your soldiers. Your problem will be how to convince your troops to fight, while our problem will be how to restrain our youths.. The youths hold you responsible for all of the killings and evictions of the Muslims and the violation of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### sanctities, carried out by your Zionist brothers in Lebanon; you openly supplied them with arms and finance. More than 600,000 Iraqi children have died due to lack of food and medicine and as a result of the unjustifiable aggression (sanction) imposed on Iraq and its nation. The children of Iraq are our children. You, the USA, together with the Saudi regime are responsible for the shedding of the blood of these innocent children. Due to all of that, what ever treaty you have with our country is now null and void.\" In 1998 he issued another fatw\u0101 against the United States, calling upon Muslims to attack America and its allies. It was entitled \"\"Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders\"\". The \"fatwa\" broke from classical Sunni legal tradition; by also advocating the killing of civilians, in addition to enemy combatants. In Afghanistan, bin Laden and al-Qaeda raised money from donors from the days of the Soviet jihad, and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for Mujahideen fighters. Bin Laden effectively took over Ariana Afghan Airlines, which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash, and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### of bin Laden's terrorist network. The arms smuggler Viktor Bout helped to run the airline, maintaining planes and loading cargo. Michael Scheuer, head of the CIA's bin Laden unit, concluded that Ariana was being used as a terrorist taxi service.</s><s>Militant and political career.:Early attacks and aid for attacks. It is believed that the first bombing attack involving bin Laden was the 29 December 1992, bombing of the Gold Mihor Hotel in Aden in which two people were killed. After this bombing, al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justification for the killing of innocent people. According to a fatwa issued by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the killing of someone standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander will find a proper reward in death, going to \"Jannah\" (paradise) if they were good Muslims and to \"Jahannam\" (hell) if they were bad or non-believers. The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the general public. In the 1990s, bin Laden's al-Qaeda assisted jihadis financially and sometimes militarily in Algeria, Egypt, and Afghanistan. In 1992 or 1993, bin Laden sent an emissary, Qari####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### el-Said, with $40,000 to Algeria to aid the Islamists and urge war rather than negotiation with the government. Their advice was heeded. The war that followed caused the deaths of 150,000\u2013200,000 Algerians and ended with the Islamist surrender to the government. In January 1996, the CIA launched a new unit of its Counterterrorism Center (CTC) called Bin Laden Issue Station, code-named \"Alec Station\", to track and to carry out operations against Bin Laden's activities. Bin Laden Issue Station was headed by Michael Scheuer, a veteran of the Islamic Extremism Branch of the CTC.</s><s>Militant and political career.:Late 1990s attacks. It has been claimed that bin Laden funded the Luxor massacre of 17 November 1997, which killed 62 civilians, and outraged the Egyptian public. In mid-1997, the Northern Alliance threatened to overrun Jalalabad, causing bin Laden to abandon his Najim Jihad compound and move his operations to Tarnak Farms in the south. Another successful attack was carried out in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan. Bin Laden helped cement his alliance with the Taliban by sending several hundred Afghan Arab fighters along to help the Taliban kill between five and six thousand Haz####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####aras overrunning the city. In February 1998, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri co-signed a \"fatwa\" in the name of the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, which declared the killing of North Americans and their allies an \"individual duty for every Muslim\" to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) and the holy mosque (in Mecca) from their grip. At the public announcement, fatwa bin Laden announced that North Americans are \"very easy targets\". He told the attending journalists, \"You will see the results of this in a very short time.\" Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on 24 June 1998. The 1998 US embassy bombings were a series of attacks that occurred on 7 August 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous truck bomb explosions at the United States embassies in the major East African cities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. The attacks were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the United States public for the first time. Al-Qaeda later claimed responsibility for the bombings. In####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### retaliation for the embassy bombings, President Bill Clinton ordered a series of cruise missile strikes on bin Laden-related targets in Sudan and Afghanistan on 20 August 1998. In December 1998, the Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorist Center reported to President Clinton that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the United States of America, including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft. On 7 June 1999, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation placed bin Laden on its Ten Most Wanted list. At the end of 2000, Richard Clarke revealed that Islamic militants headed by bin Laden had planned a triple attack on 3 January 2000, which would have included bombings in Jordan of the Radisson SAS Hotel in Amman, tourists at Mount Nebo, and a site on the Jordan River, as well as the sinking of the destroyer in Yemen, and an attack on a target within the United States. The plan was foiled by the arrest of the Jordanian terrorist cell, the sinking of the explosive-filled skiff intended to target the destroyer, and the arrest of Ahmed Ressam.</s><s>Militant and political career.:Yugoslav Wars. A former US State Department official in October 2001 described Bosnia and Herzegovina as a safe haven for terrorists, and asserted that militant elements of the former Sar####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ajevo government were protecting extremists, some with ties to Osama bin Laden. In 1997, \"Rzeczpospolita\", one of the largest Polish daily newspapers, had reported that intelligence services of the Nordic-Polish SFOR Brigade suspected that a center for training terrorists from Islamic countries was located in the Bocina Donja village near Maglaj in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1992, hundreds of volunteers joined an all-mujahedeen unit called El Moujahed in an abandoned hillside factory, a compound with a hospital and prayer hall. According to Middle East intelligence reports, bin Laden financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in Sudan. Among them was Karim Said Atmani, who was identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in the United States. He is a former roommate of Ahmed Ressam, the man arrested at the Canada\u2013United States border in mid-December 1999 with a car full of nitroglycerin and bomb-making materials. He was convicted of colluding with Osama bin Laden by a French court. A Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### other former Mujahideen who were linked to the same Algerian group or to other groups of suspected terrorists, and had lived in the area north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years. Khalil al-Deek was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites. A second man with Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with Osama bin Laden. In its 26 June 1997 report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, \"The New York Times\" noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslim forces. Further, the captured men also admitted to ties with Osama bin Laden. In 1999, the press reported that bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and Bosnian passports in 1993 by the government in Sarajevo. The Bosnian government denied this information following the September 11 attacks, but it was later found that Aodouni was arrested in Turkey and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation, a new explanation was given that bin Laden did not personally collect his Bos####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####nian passport and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who bin Laden was at the time. The Bosnian daily \"Oslobo\u0111enje\" published in 2001 that three men, believed to be linked to bin Laden, were arrested in Sarajevo in July 2001. The three, one of whom was identified as Imad El Misri, were Egyptian nationals. The paper said that two of the suspects were holding Bosnian passports. The head of Albania's State Intelligence Service (SHISH), Fatos Klosi, said that Osama was running a terror network in Albania to take part in the Kosovo War under the guise of a humanitarian organisation and it was reported to have been started in 1994. Claude Kader, who was a member, testified its existence during his trial. By 1998, four members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) were arrested in Albania and extradited to Egypt. The mujahideen fighters were organised by Islamic leaders in Western Europe allied to him and Zawihiri. During his trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, former Serbian President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 quoted from a purported FBI report that bin Laden's al-Qaeda had a presence####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in the Balkans and aided the Kosovo Liberation Army. He claimed bin Laden had used Albania as a launchpad for violence in the region and Europe. He claimed that they had informed Richard Holbrooke that KLA was being aided by al-Qaeda but the US decided to cooperate with the KLA and thus indirectly with Osama despite the 1998 United States embassy bombings earlier. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 had argued that the United States aided the terrorists, which culminated in its backing of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War.</s><s>Militant and political career.:September 11 attacks. After his initial denial,* - - - - -  in the wake of the attacks, bin Laden announced, \"what the United States is tasting today is nothing compared to what we have tasted for decades. Our \"umma\" has known this humiliation and contempt for over eighty years. Its sons are killed, its blood is spilled, its holy sites are attacked, and it is not governed according to Allah's command. Despite this, no one cares\". In response to the attacks, the United States launched the War on Terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation to preclude future attacks. The CIA's####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Special Activities Division was given the lead in tracking down and killing or capturing bin Laden. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that classified evidence linking al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the September 11 attacks is clear and irrefutable. The UK Government reached a similar conclusion regarding al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden's culpability for the September 11 attacks, although the government report noted that the evidence presented is not necessarily sufficient to prosecute the case. Bin Laden initially denied involvement in the attacks. On 16 September 2001, bin Laden read a statement later broadcast by Qatar's Al Jazeera satellite channel denying responsibility for the attack. In a videotape recovered by U.S. forces in November 2001 in Jalalabad, bin Laden was seen discussing the attack with Khaled al-Harbi in a way that indicates foreknowledge. The tape was broadcast on various news networks on 13 December 2001. The merits of this translation have been disputed. Arabist Dr. Abdel El M. Husseini stated: \"This translation is very problematic. At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic.\" In the 2004 video, bin Laden abandoned his denials without retracting past statements. In it he said he had personally directed the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### nineteen hijackers. In the 18-minute tape, played on Al-Jazeera, four days before the American presidential election, bin Laden accused U.S. President George W. Bush of negligence in the hijacking of the planes on 11 September. According to the tapes, bin Laden claimed he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War. Through two other tapes aired by Al Jazeera in 2006, Osama bin Laden announced, \"I am the one in charge of the nineteen brothers.... I was responsible for entrusting the nineteen brothers... with the raids\" (23 May 2006). In the tapes he was seen with Ramzi bin al-Shibh, as well as two of the 9/11 hijackers, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Wail al-Shehri, as they made preparations for the attacks (videotape broadcast 7 September 2006). Identified motivations of the September 11 attacks include the support of Israel by the United States, presence of the US military in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the US enforcement of sanctions against Iraq.</s><s>Criminal charges. On 16 March 1998, Libya issued the first official Interpol arrest warrant against bin Laden####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and three other people. They were charged for killing Silvan Becker, agent of Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, in the Terrorism Department, and his wife Vera in Libya on 10 March 1994. Bin Laden was still wanted by the Libyan government at the time of his death. Osama bin Laden was first indicted by a grand jury of the United States on 8 June 1998, on a charges of conspiracy to attack defense utilities of the United States and prosecutors further charged that bin Laden was the head of the terrorist organization called al-Qaeda, and that he was a major financial backer of Islamic fighters worldwide. On 4 November 1998, Osama bin Laden was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on charges of \"Murder of US Nationals Outside the United States, Conspiracy to Murder US Nationals Outside the United States, and Attacks on a Federal Facility Resulting in Death\" for his alleged role in the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The evidence against bin Laden included courtroom testimony by former al-Qaeda members and satellite phone records, from a phone purchased for him by al-Qaeda procurement agent Ziyad Khaleel in the United States. However the Taliban ruled not to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### extradite Bin Laden on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence published in the indictments and that non-Muslim courts lacked standing to try Muslims. Bin Laden became the 456th person listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, when he was added on 7 June 1999, following his indictment along with others for capital crimes in the 1998 embassy attacks. Attempts at assassination and requests for the extradition of bin Laden from the Taliban of Afghanistan were met with failure before the bombing of Afghanistan in October 2001. In 1999, US President Bill Clinton convinced the United Nations to impose sanctions against Afghanistan in an attempt to force the Taliban to extradite him. On 10 October 2001, bin Laden appeared as well on the initial list of the top 22 FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by the President of the United States George W. Bush, in direct response to the September 11 attacks, but which was again based on the indictment for the 1998 embassy attack. Bin Laden was among a group of thirteen fugitive terrorists wanted on that latter list for questioning about the 1998 embassy bombings. Bin Laden remains the only fugitive ever to be listed on both FBI fugitive lists. Despite the multiple indictments listed above and multiple requests, the Taliban refused to extradite Osama bin Laden. However####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, they did offer to try him before an Islamic court if evidence of Osama bin Laden's involvement in the September 11 attacks was provided. It was not until eight days after the bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001 that the Taliban finally did offer to turn over Osama bin Laden to a third-party country for trial in return for the United States ending the bombing. This offer was rejected by President Bush stating that this was no longer negotiable, with Bush responding \"there's no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he's guilty.\" On 15 June 2011, federal prosecutors of the United States of America officially dropped all criminal charges against Osama bin Laden following his death in May.</s><s>Pursuit by the United States.</s><s>Pursuit by the United States.:Clinton administration. Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the United States government since the presidency of Bill Clinton. Shortly after the September 11 attacks it was revealed that President Clinton had signed a directive authorizing the CIA (and specifically their elite Special Activities Division) to apprehend bin Laden and bring him to the United States to stand trial after the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Africa; if taking bin Laden alive was deemed impossible, then deadly force was authorized. On 20 August 1998, 66 cruise missiles####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### launched by United States Navy ships in the Arabian Sea struck bin Laden's training camps near Khost in Afghanistan, missing him by a few hours. In 1999 the CIA, together with Pakistani military intelligence, had prepared a team of approximately 60 Pakistani commandos to infiltrate Afghanistan to capture or kill bin Laden, but the plan was aborted by the 1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat; in 2000, foreign operatives working on behalf of the CIA had fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a convoy of vehicles in which bin Laden was traveling through the mountains of Afghanistan, hitting one of the vehicles but not the one in which bin Laden was riding. In 2000, before the September 11 attacks, Paul Bremer characterized the Clinton administration as correctly focused on bin Laden, while Robert Oakley criticized their obsession with Osama.</s><s>Pursuit by the United States.:Bush administration. Immediately after the September 11 attacks, US government officials named bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25\u00a0million for information leading to his capture or death. On 13 July 2007, the Senate voted to double the reward to $50\u00a0million, although the amount was never changed. The Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Association offered an additional $2\u00a0####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####million reward. Bin Laden was believed to be hiding in the White Mountains (Spin Ghar) in Afghanistan's east, near the Pakistani border. According to \"The Washington Post\", the US government concluded that Osama bin Laden was present during the Battle of Tora Bora, Afghanistan in late 2001, and according to civilian and military officials with first-hand knowledge, failure by the United States to commit enough US ground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the gravest failure by the United States in the war against al-Qaeda. Intelligence officials assembled what they believed to be decisive evidence, from contemporary and subsequent interrogations and intercepted communications, that bin Laden began the Battle of Tora Bora inside the cave complex along Afghanistan's mountainous eastern border. \"The Washington Post\" also reported that the CIA unit composed of special operations paramilitary forces dedicated to capturing bin Laden was shut down in late 2005. US and Afghanistan forces raided the mountain caves in Tora Bora between 14\u201316 August 2007. The military was drawn to the area after receiving intelligence of a pre-Ramadan meeting held by al-Qaeda members. After killing dozens of al-Qaeda and Taliban members, they did not find either Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahiri.</s>####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####<s>Pursuit by the United States.:Obama administration. On 7 October 2008, in the second presidential debate, on foreign policy, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama pledged, \"We will kill bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security priority.\" Upon being elected, then President-elect Obama expressed his plans to renew US commitment to finding al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to his national security advisers in an effort to ratchet up the hunt for the terrorist. President Obama rejected the Bush administration's policy on bin Laden that conflated all terror threats from al-Qaeda to Hamas to Hezbollah, replacing it with a covert, laserlike focus on al-Qaeda and its spawn. US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said in December 2009 that officials had had no reliable information on bin Laden's whereabouts for years. One week later, General Stanley McChrystal, the top US commander in Afghanistan said in December 2009 that al-Qaeda would not be defeated unless its leader, Osama bin Laden, were captured or killed. Testifying to the US Congress, he said that bin Laden had become an iconic figure, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world, and that Obama's deployment of 30####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####,000 extra troops to Afghanistan meant that success would be possible. \"I don't think that we can finally defeat al-Qaeda until he's captured or killed\", McChrystal said of bin Laden. According to him, killing or capturing bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but the movement could not be eradicated while he remained at large. In April 2011, President Obama ordered a covert operation to kill or capture bin Laden. On 2 May 2011, the White House announced that SEAL Team Six had successfully carried out the operation, killing him in his Abbottabad compound in Pakistan.</s><s>Activities and whereabouts after the September 11 attacks. While referring to Osama bin Laden in a CNN film clip on 17 September 2001, then-President George W. Bush stated, \"I want justice. There is an old poster out west, as I recall, that said, 'Wanted: Dead or alive'\". Subsequently, bin Laden retreated further from public contact to avoid capture. Numerous speculative press reports were issued about his whereabouts or even death; some placed bin Laden in different locations during overlapping time periods. None were ever definitively proven. After military offensives in Afghanistan failed to uncover his whereabouts, Pakistan was regularly identified as his suspected hiding place.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Some of the conflicting reports regarding bin Laden's whereabouts and mistaken claims about his death follow: - On 11 December 2005, a letter from Atiyah Abd al-Rahman to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi indicated that bin Laden and the al-Qaeda leadership were based in the Waziristan region of Pakistan at the time. In the letter, translated by the United States military's Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, Atiyah instructs Zarqawi to send messengers to Waziristan so that they meet with the brothers of the leadership. Al-Rahman also indicates that bin Laden and al-Qaeda are weak and have many of their own problems. The letter has been deemed authentic by military and counterterrorism officials, according to \"The Washington Post\". - Al-Qaeda continued to release time-sensitive and professionally verified videos demonstrating bin Laden's continued survival, including in August 2007. Bin Laden claimed sole responsibility for the September 11 attacks and specifically denied any prior knowledge of them by the Taliban or the Afghan people. - In 2009, a research team led by Thomas W. Gillespie and John A. Agnew of UCLA used satellite-aided geographical analysis to pinpoint three compounds in Parachinar as bin Laden's likely hideouts. - In March####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### 2009, the \"New York Daily News\" reported that the hunt for bin Laden had centered in the Chitral District of Pakistan, including the Kalam Valley. Author Rohan Gunaratna stated that captured al-Qaeda leaders had confirmed that bin Laden was hiding in Chitral. - In the first week of December 2009, a Taliban detainee in Pakistan said he had information that bin Laden was in Afghanistan in 2009. The detainee reported that in January or February (2009) he met a trusted contact who had seen bin Laden in Afghanistan about 15 to 20 days earlier. However, on 6 December 2009, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that the United States had had no reliable information on the whereabouts of bin Laden in years. Pakistan's Prime Minister Gillani rejected claims that Osama bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan. - On 9 December 2009, BBC News reported that US Army General Stanley A. McChrystal (Commander of US and ISAF forces in Afghanistan from 15 June 2009, to 23 June 2010) emphasized the continued importance of the capture or killing of bin Laden, thus indicating that the US high command believed that bin Laden was still alive. - On 2 February 2010, Afghan president Hamid Karzai arrived in Saudi Arabia for an official visit. The agenda####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### included a discussion of a possible Saudi role in Karzai's plan to reintegrate Taliban militants. During the visit, an anonymous official of the Saudi Foreign Affairs Ministry declared that the kingdom had no intention of getting involved in peacemaking in Afghanistan unless the Taliban severed ties with extremists and expelled Osama bin Laden. - On 7 June 2010, the Kuwaiti newspaper \"Al-Seyassah\" reported that bin Laden was hiding out in the mountainous town of Sabzevar, in northeastern Iran. On 9 June, \"The Australian's\" online edition repeated the claim. This report turned out to be false. - On 18 October 2010, an unnamed NATO official suggested that bin Laden was alive, well, and living comfortably in Pakistan, protected by elements of the country's intelligence services. A senior Pakistani official denied the allegations and said that the accusations were designed to put pressure on the Pakistani government ahead of talks aimed at strengthening ties between Pakistan and the United States. On 29 March 2012, Pakistani newspaper \"Dawn\" acquired a report produced by Pakistani security officials, based on interrogation of his three surviving wives, that detailed his movements while living underground in Pakistan. In a 2010 letter, bin Laden chastised followers who had reinterpreted \"al-tatarrus\"\u2014####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####an Islamic doctrine meant to excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances\u2014to justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians, which had turned Muslims against the extremist movement. Of the groups affiliated with al-Qaeda, Bin Laden condemned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan for an attack on members of a hostile tribe, declaring that the operation is not justified, as there were casualties of noncombatants. Bin Laden wrote that the \"tatarrus\" doctrine needs to be revisited based on the modern-day context and clear boundaries established. He asked a subordinate to draw up a jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order to avoid civilian casualties. In Yemen, Bin Laden urged his allies to seek a truce that would bring the country stability, or would at least show the people that they were careful in keeping Muslims safe on the basis of peace. In Somalia, he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, and he advised al-Shabab to pursue economic development. He instructed his followers around the world to focus on education and persuasion rather than entering into confrontations with Islamic political parties.</s><s>Activities and whereabouts after the September 11 attacks.:Whereabouts just before his death. In April 2011, various US intelligence outlets####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### traced Bin Laden to Abbottabad, Pakistan. It was previously believed that bin Laden was hiding near the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but he was found away in a windowless three-story mansion in Abbottabad at, southwest of the Pakistan Military Academy. Imagery from Google Earth indicates that the compound was built between 2001 and 2005.</s><s>Death and aftermath. Osama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on 2 May 2011, shortly after 1:00 AM local time (4:00 PM Eastern Time) by a United States military special operations unit. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by United States President Barack Obama and carried out in a US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation by a team of United States Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or informally by its former name, SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command, with support from CIA operatives on the ground. The raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad was launched from Afghanistan. After the raid, reports at the time stated that US forces had taken bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for positive identification, then buried it at sea, in accordance with Islamic law####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, within 24 hours of his death. Subsequent reporting has called this account into question\u2014citing, for example, the absence of evidence that there was an imam on board the, where the burial was said to have taken place. Pakistani authorities later demolished the compound in February 2012 to prevent it from becoming a neo-Islamist shrine. In February 2013, Pakistan announced plans to build a PKR\u00a0265 million (US$30 million) amusement park in the area, including the property of the former hideout. In an interview in 2019, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan claimed that Pakistani intelligence led the CIA to Osama bin Laden. It was widely reported by the press that bin Laden was fatally wounded by Robert J. O'Neill, however, it has also been widely discredited by witnesses, who claim that bin Laden was possibly already dead by the time O'Neill arrived, having been injured by an anonymous SEAL Team Six member referred to under the pseudonym \"Red\". According to Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette, bin Laden was struck by two suppressed shots to the side of the head from around ten feet away after leaning out of his bedroom doorway to survey Bissonnette and a point man, once the Navy SEALs entered the bedroom, his body began convulsing before####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Bissonnette and another SEAL responded by firing multiple shots into his chest.</s><s>Death and aftermath.:Allegations of Pakistan support-protection of bin Laden. Bin Laden was killed within the fortified complex of buildings that were probably built for him, and had reportedly been his home for at least five years. The compound was located less than from Pakistan Military Academy and less than from Pakistan's capital. While the United States and Pakistan governments both claimed, and later maintained, that no Pakistani officials, including senior military leaders, knew bin Laden's whereabouts or had prior knowledge of the US strike, Carlotta Gall, writing in \"The New York Times Magazine\" in 2014, reported that ISI Director General Ahmad Shuja Pasha knew of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad. In a 2015 \"London Review of Books\" article, investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh asserted\u2014citing US sources\u2014that bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Pasha knew of the US mission in advance, and authorized the helicopters delivering the SEALs to enter Pakistani airspace; and that the CIA learned of bin Laden's whereabouts from a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer, who was paid an estimated $25\u00a0million for the information. Both stories were denied####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### by US and Pakistani officials. Mosharraf Zia, a leading Pakistani columnist, stated, \"It seems deeply improbable that bin Laden could have been where he was killed without the knowledge of some parts of the Pakistani state.\" Pakistan's United States envoy, Ambassador Husain Haqqani, promised a \"full inquiry\" into how Pakistani intelligence services could have failed to find bin Laden in a fortified compound so close to Islamabad. \"Obviously bin Laden did have a support system\", he said. \"The issue is, was that support system within the government and the state of Pakistan, or within the society of Pakistan?\" Others argued that bin Laden lived in the compound with a local family, and never used the internet or a mobile phone, which would have made him much easier to locate. Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari denied that his country's security forces sheltered bin Laden, and called any supposed support for bin Laden by the Pakistani government baseless speculation. Government officials said that the country's limited resources had been committed to its war against the Pakistan Taliban, and other insurgents who posed an active threat to it, rather than to finding or sheltering bin Laden. Coll states that as of 2019 there is no direct evidence showing Pakistani knowledge of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. Documents captured from the Abbottabad compound generally show that bin Laden was wary of contact with Pakistani intelligence and police, especially in light of Pakistan's role in the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</s><s>Legacy. Despite condemnations from U.S-allied governments in the Arab world, anti-American protestors from Pakistan to Palestinian territories used Bin Laden's portraits during their protests, speeches and public campaigns; owing to his widespread popularity that once pervaded the Arab World in the early 2000s. His popularity reached its apex through the course of the Iraq war; during which opinion polls conducted in various Muslim countries gave him 50% - 60% favourable ratings.</s><s>See also. - The Golden Chain - Islamic extremism - Islamic fundamentalism - Islamic terrorism - List of assassinations by the United States - Osama bin Laden in popular culture - Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism</s><s>References.</s><s>References.:Bibliography. - - - - - -</s><s>Further reading. - - - - - - - Foreign Broadcast Information Service (2006) \u2013 Compilation of Usama Bin Laden Statements 1994 \u2013 January 2004 - - - -</s>", "Osama bin Laden was a Saudi Arabian-born terrorist and the founder of the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda.

In domestic cricket, he represents Somerset. Leach made his Test debut in 2018. He plays as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler.</s><s>Early life and education. Leach was born in Taunton, England on 22 June 1991, and attended Trinity School, Bishop Fox's School and Richard Huish College all in Taunton. He used to be employed to park trolleys at a branch of Sainsbury's supermarket in Taunton. At the age of 14, Leach was diagnosed with Crohn's disease.</s><s>Cricket career. Leach graduated from the Somerset County Cricket Club academy in the summer of 2010, prior to signing a professional contract with Somerset. Leach represented Dorset County Cricket Club in the 2010 Minor Counties Cricket Championship, and bowled his side to victory in the final against Lincolnshire taking 6/21 in their second innings. Leach completed his degree at the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff in sports coaching. Whilst attending university Leach represented Cardiff MCCU in 2011 and 2012 making his first-class debut against his county side Somerset in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### March 2012, bowling 41 overs but failing to take a wicket as Somerset amassed 642/3d. Leach made his Somerset debut in a two-day match against the touring South Africans in July 2012, claiming the prized wicket of Hashim Amla. He made his first-class debut for Somerset in the 2012 County Championship match against Lancashire in August 2012, the rain affected match finished as a draw with Leach claiming Kyle Hogg as his maiden first-class wicket. Further opportunities in the first team were limited for the rest of the 2012 season with the signing of Pakistani spinner Abdur Rehman, and Leach only featured in one further County Championship match and three matches in the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40, but ended the season ninth in the national first-class averages with 12 wickets at 18.83 runs apiece. Leach spent the 2012\u201313 winter playing grade cricket for Valley District Cricket Club in Brisbane, Australia, helping his side to win the T20 competition. Leach returned to Somerset for pre-season on a summer contract and played his first Championship game of the season against Warwickshire due to an injury to first choice spinner George Dockrell; he took his maiden five-wicket haul in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the second innings, with 24 of his 44 overs being maidens. Leach made his Twenty20 debut on 23 June 2021, for Somerset in the 2021 T20 Blast. In April 2022, he was bought by the Birmingham Phoenix for the 2022 season of The Hundred.</s><s>International career. On 14 February 2018, while playing for the England Lions against West Indies A, Leach achieved match figures of 8\u2013110; in doing so, he beat the previous best figures by an England Lions spinner (Graeme Swann's 8\u2013156).</s><s>International career.:2018\u201321: Sporadic appearances. On 16 March 2018, he was called up to England's Test squad for the tour of New Zealand as an injury replacement for Mason Crane. He made his debut in the second Test in Christchurch. After losing his place to Adil Rashid and then Moeen Ali in the 2018 home summer, Leach was recalled for the winter tour of Sri Lanka. In an unusual circumstance, with one over left to play in the day during the second test, Leach opened England's innings as a nightwatchman, surviving till stumps. He was dismissed for 1 off 11 balls the next morning. He did not play in England's subsequent tour of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### West Indies but returned for the one-off Test against Ireland. Leach was once again the nightwatchman for England, batting for a single over at the close of day one. England won the Test by 143 runs, with Leach scoring 92 runs, which earned him the man of the match award. After Ali was preferred for the first 2019 Ashes test, Leach was then recalled for the second Ashes test at Lords, on 14 August 2019, where he scored 6 not out in the first innings and took 1-19 and 3\u201337 in Australia's first and second innings respectively. England drew the match. Leach scored one run, tying the game, in a partnership of 76 with Ben Stokes, to help England win the third Ashes test at Headingley, by one wicket. It has been described as \"arguably the greatest one not out in the history of the game\". Leach gained a cult following over the summer of 2019, with his glasses being a contributing factor. He regularly cleans them through his innings, and has received free Specsavers glasses for life following his heroics supporting Ben Stokes in the dramatic Headingley test. This cult reputation was enhanced by his behaviour off the pitch, such as leading some of the England team####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### out to recreate his famous run at Headingley after the match. Leach played the rest of the series including a pivotal role in the final test, bowling England to victory with figures of 4\u201349. Over the 2019\u201320 winter, Leach only played one of England's six tests: he was not selected for the second test against New Zealand, England opting to play an extra seam bowler instead; he missed the Basil D'Oliviera Trophy due to illness. On 29 May 2020, Leach was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June 2020, Leach was included in England's 30-man squad to start training behind closed doors for the Test series against the West Indies. However, Dominic Bess was preferred for the 2020 home summer. Leach returned to the team for the winter tours against Sri Lanka and the Anthony De Mello Trophy. Therein he took 28 wickets across the six tests, but did not retain his place for the summer; England instead opting not to use a spinner against New Zealand and then preferring Moeen Ali for the Pataudi Trophy.</s><s>International career.:2021\u2013present: First####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Choice spinner. Following the sudden retirement of Ali, Leach was included in the 2021\u201322 Ashes series squad and was selected ahead of Stuart Broad for the first test at The Gabba despite the pitch being a \"green top\" which favoured the seamers. He returned match figures of 1\u2013102 with an economy rate of 7.84, one of the worst innings economy rates in history.. He was in and out of the team for the rest of the series - England choosing not to play him when a pink ball was in use - but improved through the series and finished with six wickets at an average of 53.50. He played all three Tests in the inaugural Richards\u2013Botham Trophy and finished joint leading wicket taker in the series with Kemar Roach and Jayden Seales as England lost the series 1\u20130. He also scored 41 not out in the final test but it was not enough to prevent defeat. Following the ascendency of Ben Stokes to the captaincy Leach was given a more senior role in the side, playing every test match for which he was available. Despite being ruled out of the first test against New Zealand due to a concussion sustained whilst fielding, he returned for the next test, and in the final test of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the series he recorded his first ten-wicket haul in Tests with 10\u2013166 in the match. He was less prolific against South Africa, as the low-scoring nature of the series meant he was often not required to bowl, but in the 2022\u201323 winter he took 25 wickets across five tests against Pakistan and New Zealand, including a five-wicket haul in Wellington. The media, and Leach himself, have praised Stokes's handling of Leach. Notably, Stokes has kept attacking fields for Leach even when batters have looked to attack him.

Despite harbouring ambitions of playing football professionally, Rami only played the sport as a hobby and worked for city hall to support himself. He made his amateur debut for the club during the 2003\u201304 season while Fr\u00e9jus were playing in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. He appeared in four matches in his first####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### season. In the 2004\u201305 season, Rami appeared in 24 matches as Fr\u00e9jus finished mid-table. Ahead of the 2005\u201306 season, Rami switched to playing in central defence. He initially played as an offensive player often in the midfield, but following an injury to a teammate, whom Rami described as his best friend, his coaches inserted him into defence. The transition was a success, with Rami appearing in 30 matches with Fr\u00e9jus finishing mid-table for the third consecutive season. Midway through the campaign, Rami was offered a trial by professional club Lille. Eager to leave the amateur club, he took the opportunity and after a week's training session with Lille, which Rami described as \"hard\", he was signed to an amateur contract with Fr\u00e9jus receiving \u20ac10,000.</s><s>Club career.:Lille. Upon his arrival to the club, Rami was inserted onto the club's Championnat de France amateur team and was supervised by coach Pascal Planque, who Rami stated gave him the best opportunity to grow as a player. Rami appeared in 27 matches as the team finished in third position, the highest finish amongst professional clubs' reserve team's playing in the group. With####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### two months remaining in the 2006\u201307 Ligue 1 season, Rami was called up to the senior team by manager Claude Puel. He made his professional debut on 19 May 2007 in a Ligue 1 match against Auxerre, starting at centre-back. The following week, Rami started again, against Rennes. On 4 June, Rami signed his first professional contract after agreeing to a three-year deal lasting until 2010. He was then promoted to the senior squad on a permanent basis and assigned the number 23 shirt. In the 2007\u201308 season, Rami was declared a starter by Puel and inserted at centre-back, alongside captain Gr\u00e9gory Tafforeau. In the opening match of the season, against Lorient, Rami featured in the match until the 69th minute, when he suffered an injury to ligaments in one of his knees. He subsequently missed three-and-a-half months due to the injury, returning in November 2007. Upon his return, Rami featured in every remaining match for Lille, save for one league match. Lille finished the campaign in seventh position, one spot out of Europe. After the season, Rami signed a two-year contract extension with the club.

On 1 February 2009, he scored the would-be game-winner against Bordeaux in the 57th minute. However, the goal was canceled out eight minutes later by Yoann Gourcuff to draw the match at 2\u20132. Rami's fourth and final goal of the season was the team's second goal in a 3\u20132 win over Nancy on the final day of the league season. The victory secured fifth place for Lille, which resulted in the club qualifying for the newly created UEFA Europa League. Following the season, Rami drew considerable interest from several clubs, which included French clubs Marseille and Lyon, English clubs Liverpool and Arsenal and Italian club Milan. Despite suitable offers for the player, Lille chairman Michel Seydoux declared that Rami was not going to be leaving the club after a reported move to Marseille for \u20ac12\u00a0million was abruptly canceled in July 2009. The announcement led to a distraught and angry####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Rami declaring he would see out the rest of his contract with Lille playing in the reserves if he was not transferred. He even went as far as to state that there was a conspiracy between Lille and Lyon, due to the club's easy negotiations during transfers between each other, as well as Seydoux's brother, J\u00e9r\u00f4me, being a shareholder of Lyon. On 15 August 2009, Rami apologized for the comments and said he would remain at Lille.

Its sound featured his melodic, blues-based lines set against Latin American and African rhythms played on percussion instruments not generally heard in rock, such as timbales and congas. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine listed him at No. 20 on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists. He has won 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards, and was inducted along with his namesake band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.</s><s>Biography.</s><s>Biography.:Early life. Santana was born in Autl\u00e1n de Navarro in Jalisco, Mexico on July 20, 1947. He learned to play the violin at age five and the guitar at age eight, under the tutelage of his father, who was a mariachi musician. His younger brother, Jorge, also became a professional guitarist. Santana was heavily influenced by Ritchie Valens at a time when####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### there were very few Mexicans in American rock music. The family moved from Autl\u00e1n to Tijuana, on the border with the U.S. They then moved to San Francisco, California, where his father had steady work. In October 1966, Santana started the Santana Blues Band. By 1968, the band had begun to incorporate different types of influences into their electric blues. Santana later said, \"If I would go to some cat's room, he'd be listening to Sly [Stone] and Jimi Hendrix; another guy to the Stones and the Beatles. Another guy'd be listening to Tito Puente and Mongo Santamar\u00eda. Another guy'd be listening to Miles [Davis] and [John] Coltrane... to me, it was like being at a university.\" Around the age of eight, Santana \"fell under the influence\" of blues performers like B.B. King, Javier B\u00e1tiz, Mike Bloomfield, and John Lee Hooker. G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3's mid-1960s jazz guitar work also strongly influenced Santana's playing. Indeed, Szab\u00f3's composition \"Gypsy Queen\" was used as the second part of Santana's 1970 treatment of Peter Green's composition \"Black Magic Woman\", almost down to identical####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### guitar licks. Santana's 2012 instrumental album \"Shape Shifter\" includes a song called \"Mr. Szabo\", played in tribute in the style of Szab\u00f3. Santana also credits Hendrix, Bloomfield, Hank Marvin, and Peter Green as important influences; he considered Bloomfield a direct mentor, writing of a key meeting with Bloomfield in San Francisco in the foreword he wrote to a 2000 biography of Bloomfield, \"Michael Bloomfield: If You Love These Blues \u2013 An Oral History\". Between the ages of 10 and 12, he was sexually abused by an American man who brought him across the border. Santana lived in the Mission District, graduated from James Lick Middle School, and left Mission High School in 1965. He was accepted at California State University, Northridge and Humboldt State University, but chose not to attend college.</s><s>Biography.:Early career. Santana was influenced by popular artists of the 1950s such as B.B. King, T-Bone Walker, Javier Batiz, and John Lee Hooker. Soon after he began playing guitar, he joined local bands along the \"Tijuana Strip\" where he was able to begin developing his own sound. He was also introduced to a variety of new musical influences, including####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### jazz and folk music, and witnessed the growing hippie movement centered in San Francisco in the 1960s. After several years spent working as a dishwasher at Tic Tock Drive-In No2 and busking to pay for a Gibson SG, replacing a destroyed Gibson Melody Maker, Santana decided to become a full-time musician. In 1966, he was chosen along with other musicians to form an ad hoc band to substitute for that of an intoxicated Paul Butterfield set to play a Sunday matinee at Bill Graham's Fillmore Auditorium. Graham selected the substitutes from musicians he knew primarily through his connections with the Butterfield Blues Band, Grateful Dead, and Jefferson Airplane. Santana's guitar playing caught the attention of both the audience and Graham. During the same year he and fellow street musicians David Brown (bass guitar), Marcus Malone (percussion) and Gregg Rolie (lead vocals, Hammond Organ B3), formed the Santana Blues Band. Playing a highly original blend of Latin-infused rock, jazz, blues, salsa, and African rhythms, the band gained an immediate following on the San Francisco club circuit.</s><s>Biography.:Record deal, Woodstock breakthrough, and height of success: 1969\u20131972. Santana's band was signed by Columbia Records####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, which shortened its name to simply \"Santana\". It went into the studio to record its first album in January 1969, finally laying down tracks in May that became its first album. Members were not satisfied with the release, dismissed drummer Bob Livingston, and added Mike Shrieve, who had a strong background in both jazz and rock. The band then lost percussionist Marcus Malone, who was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Michael Carabello was re-enlisted in his place, bringing with him experienced Nicaraguan percussionist Jos\u00e9 Chepito Areas. Major rock music promoter Bill Graham, a Latin Music aficionado who had been a fan of Santana from its inception, arranged for the band to appear at the Woodstock Music and Art Festival before its debut album was even released. Its set was one of the surprises of the festival, highlighted by an eleven-minute performance of a throbbing instrumental, \"Soul Sacrifice\". Its inclusion in the \"Woodstock\" film and soundtrack album vastly increased the band's popularity. Graham also suggested Santana record the Willie Bobo song \"Evil Ways\", as he felt it would get radio airplay. The band's first album, \"Santana\", was released in August 1969 and became a hit, reaching No. 4 on the U####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####.S. Billboard 200. The band's performance at Woodstock and the follow-up sound track and movie introduced them to an international audience and garnered critical acclaim. The sudden success which followed put pressure on the group, highlighting the different musical directions Rolie and Santana were starting to go. Rolie, along with some of the other band members, wanted to emphasize a basic hard rock sound which had been a key component in establishing the band from the start. Santana, however, was increasingly interested in moving beyond his love of blues and rock and wanted more jazzy, ethereal elements in the music. He became fascinated with G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3, Miles Davis, Pharoah Sanders, and John Coltrane, as well as developing a growing interest in spirituality. At the same time, Chepito Areas was stricken with a near-fatal brain hemorrhage, and Santana hoped to continue by finding a temporary replacement (first Willie Bobo, then Coke Escovedo), while others in the band, especially Michael Carabello, felt it was wrong to perform publicly without Areas. Cliques formed, and the band started to disintegrate. Consolidating the interest generated by their first album, and their highly acclaimed live performance at the Woodstock####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Festival in August 1969, the band followed up with their second album, \"Abraxas\", in September 1970. The album's mix of rock, blues, jazz, salsa and other influences was very well received, showing a musical maturation from their first album and refining the band's early sound. \"Abraxas\" included two of Santana's most enduring and well-known hits, \"Oye Como Va\", and \"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen\". \"Abraxas\" spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard chart at the end of 1970. The album remained on the charts for 88 weeks and was certified 4\u00d7 platinum in 1986. In 2003, the album was ranked number 205 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Teenage San Francisco Bay Area guitar prodigy Neal Schon joined the Santana band in 1971, in time to complete the third album, \"Santana III\". The band now boasted a powerful dual-lead-guitar act that gave the album a tougher sound. The sound of the band was also helped by the return of a recuperated Chepito Areas and the assistance of Coke Escovedo in the percussion section. Enhancing the band's sound further was the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### support of popular Bay Area group Tower of Power's horn section, Luis Gasca of Malo, and other session musicians which added to both percussion and vocals, injecting more energy to the proceedings. \"Santana III\" was another success, reaching No. 1 on the album charts, selling two million copies, and yielding the hit \"No One to Depend On\". Tension between members of the band continued, however. Along with musical differences, drug use became a problem, and Santana was deeply worried that it was affecting the band's performance. Coke Escovedo encouraged Santana to take more control of the band's musical direction, much to the dismay of some of the others who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort. Also, financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of Stan Marcum, whom Bill Graham criticized as being incompetent. Growing resentments between Santana and Michael Carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms. James Mingo Lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement at a concert in New York City. David Brown later left due to substance abuse problems. A South American tour was cut short in Lima, Peru due to unruly fans and student protests against U.S. governmental policies. In January 1972, Santana####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, Schon, Escovedo, and Lewis joined former Band of Gypsys drummer Buddy Miles for a concert at Hawaii's Diamond Head Crater, which was recorded for the album \"Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles! Live!\", which became a gold record.</s><s>Biography.:\"Caravanserai\". In early 1972, Santana and the remaining members of the band started working on their fourth album, \"Caravanserai\". During the studio sessions, Santana and Michael Shrieve brought in other musicians: percussionists James Mingo Lewis and Latin-Jazz veteran, Armando Peraza replacing Michael Carabello, and bassists Tom Rutley and Doug Rauch replacing David Brown. Also assisting on keyboards were Wendy Haas and Tom Coster. With the unsettling influx of new players in the studio, Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon decided that it was time to leave after the completion of the album, even though both contributed to the session. Rolie returned home to Seattle; later, he and Schon became founding members of Journey. When \"Caravanserai\" did emerge in 1972, it marked a strong change in musical direction towards jazz fusion. The album received critical praise, but CBS executive Clive Davis warned Santana and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the band that it would sabotage the band's position as a \"Top 40\" act. Nevertheless, over the years, the album achieved platinum status. The difficulties Santana and the band went through during this period were chronicled in Ben Fong-Torres' \"Rolling Stone\" 1972 cover story \"The Resurrection of Carlos Santana\".</s><s>Biography.:Shifting styles and spirituality: 1972\u20131979. In 1972, Santana became interested in the pioneering fusion band the Mahavishnu Orchestra and its guitarist, John McLaughlin. Aware of Santana's interest in meditation, McLaughlin introduced Santana and his wife Deborah to his guru Sri Chinmoy. Chinmoy accepted them as disciples in 1973. Santana was given the name Devadip, meaning \"The lamp, light and eye of God\". Santana and McLaughlin recorded an album together, \"Love, Devotion, Surrender\" (1973) with members of Santana and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, along with percussionist Don Alias and organist Larry Young, both of whom had made appearances, along with McLaughlin, on Miles Davis' classic 1970 album \"Bitches Brew\". In 1973, Santana, having obtained legal rights to the band's name, \"Santana\", formed a new version of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the band with Armando Peraza and Chepito Areas on percussion, Doug Rauch on bass, Michael Shrieve on drums, and Tom Coster and Richard Kermode on keyboards. Santana later was able to recruit jazz vocalist Leon Thomas for the tour supporting \"Caravanserai\" in Japan on July 3 and 4, 1973, which was recorded for the 1974 live, sprawling, high-energy triple vinyl LP fusion album \"Lotus\". CBS records would not allow its release unless the material was condensed. Santana did not agree to those terms, and \"Lotus\" was available in the U.S. only as an expensive, imported, three-record set. The group later went into the studio and recorded \"Welcome\" (1973), which further reflected Santana's interests in jazz fusion and his increasing commitment to the spiritual life of Sri Chinmoy. A collaboration with John Coltrane's widow, Alice Coltrane, \"Illuminations\" (1974), followed. The album delved into avant-garde esoteric free jazz, Eastern Indian and classical influences with other ex-Miles Davis sidemen Jack DeJohnette and Dave Holland. Soon after, Santana replaced his band members again. This time Kermode, Thomas####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and Rauch departed from the group and were replaced by vocalist Leon Patillo (later a successful Contemporary Christian artist) and returning bassist David Brown. He also recruited soprano saxophonist Jules Broussard for the lineup. The band recorded one studio album \"Borboletta\", which was released in 1974. Drummer Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler later joined the band as a replacement for Michael Shrieve, who left to pursue a solo career. By this time, Bill Graham's management company had assumed responsibility for the affairs of the group. Graham was critical of Santana's move into jazz and felt he needed to concentrate on getting \"Santana\" back into the charts with the edgy, streetwise ethnic sound that had made them famous. Santana himself was seeing that the group's direction was alienating many fans. Although the albums and performances were given good reviews by critics in jazz and jazz fusion circles, sales had plummeted. Santana, along with Tom Coster, producer David Rubinson, and Chancler, formed yet another version of \"Santana\", adding vocalist Greg Walker. The 1976 album \"Amigos\", which featured the songs \"Dance, Sister, Dance\" and \"Let It Shine\",####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### had a strong funk and Latin sound. The album received considerable airplay on FM album-oriented rock stations with the instrumental \"Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)\" and re-introduced \"Santana\" to the charts. In 1976, \"Rolling Stone\" ran a second cover story on \"Santana\" entitled \"Santana Comes Home\". In February 1976, Santana was presented with fifteen gold disc in Australia, representing sales in excess of 244,000. The albums conceived through the late 1970s followed the same formula, although with several lineup changes. Among the new personnel who joined was current percussionist Raul Rekow, who joined in early 1977. Most notable of the band's commercial efforts of this era was a version of the 1960s Zombies hit, \"She's Not There\", on the 1977 double album \"Moonflower\". Santana recorded two solo projects in this time: \"Oneness: Silver Dreams \u2013 Golden Reality\", in 1979 and \"The Swing of Delight\" in 1980, which featured Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams. The pressures and temptations of being a high-profile rock musician and requirements of the spiritual lifestyle which guru Sri Chinmoy and his followers demanded were in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### conflict, and imposed considerable stress upon Santana's lifestyle and marriage. He was becoming increasingly disillusioned with what he thought were the unreasonable rules that Chinmoy imposed on his life, and in particular with his refusal to allow Santana and Deborah to start a family. He felt too that his fame was being used to increase the guru's visibility. Santana and Deborah eventually ended their relationship with Chinmoy in 1982.</s><s>Biography.:1980s and early 1990s. More radio-friendly singles followed from Santana and the band. \"Winning\" in 1981 (from \"Zebop!\") and \"Hold On\" (a remake of the Canadian artist Ian Thomas' song) in 1982 both reached the top twenty. After his break with Sri Chinmoy, Santana went into the studio to record another solo album with Keith Olson and legendary R&B producer Jerry Wexler. The 1983 album \"Havana Moon\" revisited Santana's early musical experiences in Tijuana with Bo Diddley's \"Who Do You Love\" and the title cut, Chuck Berry's \"Havana Moon\". The album's guests included Booker T. Jones, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Willie Nelson, and even Santana's father's mariachi orchestra. Santana again paid####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### tribute to his early rock roots by doing the film score to \"La Bamba\", which was based on the life of rock and roll legend Ritchie Valens and starred Lou Diamond Phillips. The band \"Santana\" returned in 1985 with a new album, \"Beyond Appearances\", and two years later with \"Freedom\". Freedom is the fifteenth studio album by Santana. By this recording, Santana had nine members, some of whom had returned after being with the band in previous versions, including lead singer on the album Buddy Miles. Freedom moved away from the more poppy sound of the previous album, Beyond Appearances and back to the band's original Latin rock. Growing weary of trying to appease record company executives with formulaic hit records, Santana took great pleasure in jamming and making guest appearances with notables such as the jazz fusion group Weather Report, jazz pianist McCoy Tyner, Blues legend John Lee Hooker, Frank Franklin, Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, and West African singer Salif Keita. He and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead later recorded and performed with Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji, who conceived one of Santana's famous 1960s drum jams, \"Jingo\". In 1988, Santana organized a reunion with past members from the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Santana band for a series of concert dates. CBS records released a 20-year retrospective of the band's accomplishments with \"Viva Santana!\" double CD compilation. That same year, Santana formed an all-instrumental group featuring jazz legend Wayne Shorter on tenor and soprano saxophone. The group also included Patrice Rushen on keyboards, Alphonso Johnson on bass, Armando Peraza and Chepito Areas on percussion, and Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler on drums. They toured briefly and received much acclaim from the music press, who compared the effort with the era of \"Caravanserai\" (1972). Santana released another solo record, \"Blues for Salvador\" (1987), which won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In 1990, Santana left Columbia Records after twenty-two years and signed with Polygram. The following year he made a guest appearance on Ottmar Liebert's album, \"Solo Para Ti\" (1991), on the songs \"Reaching out 2 U\" and on a cover of his own song, \"Samba Pa Ti\". In 1992, Santana hired the jam band Phish as his opening act. On his 1992 tour, Santana regularly invited some or all of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### members of Phish to jam with his band during his headlining performances. Phish also toured with Santana in Europe in 1996.</s><s>Biography.:Return to commercial success. Santana kicked off the 1990s with a new album \"Spirits Dancing in the Flesh\" in 1990. This was followed by \"Milagro\" in 1992, a live album \"\" in 1993 and \"Brothers\" (a collaboration with his brother Jorge and nephew Carlos Hernandez) in 1994, but sales were relatively poor. Santana toured widely over the next few years but there were no further new album releases, and eventually, he was even without a recording contract. However, Arista Records' Clive Davis, who had worked with Santana at Columbia Records, signed him and encouraged him to record a star-studded album with mostly younger artists. The result was 1999's \"Supernatural\", which included collaborations with Everlast, Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty, Eric Clapton, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, CeeLo Green, Man\u00e1, Dave Matthews, KC Porter, J. B. Eckl, and others. However, the lead single was what grabbed the attention of both fans and the music industry. \"Smooth\", a dynamic cha-cha####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### stop-start number co-written and sung by Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty, was laced throughout with Santana's guitar fills and runs. The track's energy was immediately apparent on radio, and it was played on a wide variety of station formats. \"Smooth\" spent twelve weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming in the process the last No. 1 single of the 1990s. The music video, set on a hot barrio street, was also very popular. \"Supernatural\" reached number one on the US album charts and the follow-up single, \"Maria Maria\", featuring the R&B duo the Product G&B, also hit number one, spending ten weeks there in the spring of 2000. \"Supernatural\" eventually shipped over 15 million copies in the United States, and won 8 Grammy Awards including Album of the Year, making it Santana's most successful album. Carlos Santana, alongside the classic \"Santana\" lineup of their first two albums, was inducted as an individual, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. He performed \"Black Magic Woman\" with the writer of the song, Fleetwood Mac's founder Peter Green. Green was inducted the same night. In 2000, \"Supernatural\" won####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### nine Grammy Awards (eight for Santana personally), including Album of the Year, Record of the Year for \"Smooth\", and Song of the Year for Thomas and Itaal Shur. Santana's acceptance speeches described his feelings about music's place in one's spiritual existence. Later that year at the Latin Grammy Awards, he won three awards including Record of the Year. In 2001, Santana's guitar skills were featured in Michael Jackson's song \"Whatever Happens\" from the album \"Invincible\". In 2002, Santana released \"Shaman\", revisiting the \"Supernatural\" format of guest artists including Citizen Cope, P.O.D., and Seal. Although the album was not the runaway success its predecessor had been, it produced two radio-friendly hits. \"The Game of Love\" featuring Michelle Branch rose to number five on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and spent many weeks at the top of the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, and \"Why Don't You & I\" written by and featuring Chad Kroeger from the group Nickelback (the original and a remix with Alex Band from the group the Calling were combined towards chart performance) which reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100. \"The Game of Love\" went on to win the Grammy Award for Best####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Pop Collaboration with Vocals. In the same year, he was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame. In early August 2003, Santana was named fifteenth on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". In 2004, Santana was honored as the Person of the Year by the Latin Recording Academy. On April 21, 2005, Santana was honored as a BMI Icon at the 12th annual BMI Latin Awards. Santana was the first songwriter designated a BMI Icon at the company's Latin Awards. The honor is given to a creator who has been \"a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers.\" In 2005, Herbie Hancock approached Santana to collaborate on an album again using the \"Supernatural\" formula. \"Possibilities\" was released on August 30, 2005, featuring Carlos Santana and Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo on \"Safiatou\". Also, in 2005, fellow Latin star Shakira invited Santana to play the soft rock guitar ballad \"Illegal\" on her second English-language studio album \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\". Santana's 2005 album \"All That I Am\" consists primarily of collaborations with other artists; the first single, the peppy \"I####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####'m Feeling You\", was again with Michelle Branch and the Wreckers. Other musicians joining the mix this time included Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Kirk Hammett from Metallica, hip-hop artist/songwriter/producer will.i.am, guitarist/songwriter/producer George Pajon, hip-hop/reggae star Sean Paul, and R&B singer Joss Stone. In April and May 2006, Santana toured Europe, where he promoted his son Salvador Santana's band as his opening act. In 2007, Santana appeared, along with Sheila E. and Jos\u00e9 Feliciano, on Gloria Estefan's album \"90 Millas,\" on the single \"No Llores\". He also teamed again with Chad Kroeger for the hit single \"Into the Night\". He also played guitar in Eros Ramazzotti's hit \"Fuoco nel fuoco\" from the album \"e\u00b2\". In 2008, Santana was reported to be working with his longtime friend, Marcelo Vieira, on his solo album \"Acoustic Demos\", which was released at the end of the year. It features tracks such as \"For Flavia\" and \"Across the Grave\", the latter said to feature heavy melodic riffs####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### by Santana. Santana performed at the 2009 American Idol Finale with the top 13 finalists, which starred many acts such as KISS, Queen and Rod Stewart. On July 8, 2009, Santana appeared at the Athens Olympic Stadium in Athens with his 10-member all-star band as part of his \"Supernatural Santana \u2013 A Trip through the Hits\" European tour. On July 10, 2009, he also appeared at Philip II Stadium in Skopje. With a 2.5-hour long concert and 20\u00a0000 people, Santana appeared for the first time in that region. \"Supernatural Santana \u2013 A Trip through the Hits\" was played at the Hard Rock hotel in Las Vegas, where it was played through 2011. Santana is featured as a playable character in the music video game Guitar Hero 5. A live recording of his song \"No One to Depend On\" is included in game, which was released on September 1, 2009. More recently, in 2011, three Santana songs were offered as downloadable content (DLC) for guitar learning software Rocksmith: \"Oye Como Va\", \"Smooth\", and \"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen\". In the same year, Santana received the Billboard Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award. Santana, since 2007, has####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### opened a chain of upscale Mexican restaurants called \"Maria Maria\". It is a combined effort with Chef Roberto Santiba\u00f1ez.

The same month, he performed in New York's Central Park along with Rob Thomas and Wyclef Jean.</s><s>Equipment.</s><s>Equipment.:Guitars and effects. Santana played a red Gibson SG Special with P-90 pickups at the Woodstock festival (####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####1969). During 1970\u20131972, between the release of \"Abraxas\" (1970) and \"Santana III\" 1971, he used different Gibson Les Pauls and a black Gibson SG Special. In 1974, he played and endorsed the Gibson L6-S Custom. This can be heard on the album \"Borboletta\" (1974). From 1976 until 1982, his main guitar was a Yamaha SG 175B, and sometimes a white Gibson SG Custom with three open-coil pick-ups. In 1982, he started to use a custom made PRS Custom 24 guitar. In 1988 PRS Guitars began making Santana signature model guitars, which Santana has played through its various iterations ever since (see below). Santana currently uses a Santana II model guitar fitted with PRS Santana III nickel-covered pickups, a tremolo bar, and.009\u2013.042 gauge D'Addario strings. He also plays a PRS Santana MD \"The Multidimensional\" guitar. The Santana guitars feature necks made of a single piece of mahogany topped with rosewood fretboards (some feature highly sought-after Brazilian rosewood). Santana Signature models: - PRS Santana I \"The Yellow\" guitar (1988) - PRS Santana II####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"Supernatural\" guitar (1999) - PRS Santana III guitar (2001) - PRS Santana SE guitar (2001) - PRS Santana SE II guitar (2003) - PRS Santana Shaman SE-Limited Edition guitar (2003) - PRS Santana MD \"The Multidimensional\" guitar (2008) - PRS Santana 25th Anniversary guitar (2009) - PRS Santana Abraxas SE-Limited Edition guitar (2009) - PRS Santana SE \"The Multidimensional\" guitar (2011) - PRS Santana Retro guitar (2017) - PRS Santana Yellow SE guitar (2017) Santana also uses a classical guitar, the Alvarez Yairi CY127CE with Alvarez tension nylon strings, in the last years from 2009 he uses custom made, semi-hollow Toru Nittono's \"Model-T\" Jazz Electric Nylon. Santana does not use many effects pedals. His PRS guitar is connected to a Mu-Tron Wah-wah pedal (or, more recently, a Dunlop 535Q wah and a T-Rex Replica delay pedal, then through a customized Jim Dunlop amp switcher which in turn is connected to the different amps or cabinets. Previous setups include an Ibanez####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Tube Screamer right after the guitar. He is also known to have used an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff distortion for his famous sustain. In the song \"Stand Up\" from the album \"Marathon\" (1979), Santana uses a Heil talk box in the guitar solo. He has also used the Audiotech Guitar Products 1x6 Rack Mount Audio Switcher in rehearsals for the 2008 \"Live Your Light\" tour. Santana uses two different guitar picks: the large triangular Dunlop he has used for so many years, and the V-Pick Freakishly Large Round.</s><s>Equipment.:Amplifiers. Santana's distinctive guitar tone is produced by PRS Santana signature guitars plugged into multiple amplifiers. The amps consist of a Mesa Boogie Mark I, Dumble Overdrive Reverb and more recently a Bludotone amplifier. Santana compares the tonal qualities of each amplifier to that of a singer producing head/nasal tones, chest tones, and belly tones. A three-way amp switcher is employed on Carlos's pedal board to enable him to switch between amps. Often the unique tones of each amplifier are blended together, complementing each other producing a richer tone. He also put the \"Boogie\" in Mesa####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Boogie. Santana is credited with coining the popular Mesa amplifier name when he tried one and exclaimed, \"That little thing really Boogies!\" Specifically, Santana combines a Mesa/Boogie Mark I head running through a Boogie cabinet with Altec 417-8H (or recently JBL E120s) speakers, and a Dumble Overdrive Reverb and/or a Dumble Overdrive Special running through a Brown or Marshall 4x12 cabinet with Celestion G12M \"Greenback\" speakers, depending on the desired sound. Shure KSM-32 microphones are used to pick up the sound, going to the PA. Additionally, a Fender Cyber-Twin Amp is mostly used at home. During his early career, Santana used a GMT transistor amplifier stack and a silverface Fender Twin. The GMT 226A rig was used at the Woodstock concert as well as during recording Santana's debut album. During this era, Santana also began to use the Fender Twin, which was also used on the debut and proceedingly at the recording sessions of Abraxas.</s><s>Personal life. In 1965, Santana became a naturalized U.S. citizen. After discovering Chinmoy and Yogandanda in 1972, Santana quit marijuana####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### until 1981. In 2020, Santana launched his own brand of cannabis named Mirayo that honours \"the spiritual and ancient Latin heritage of the plant.\" From 1973 to 2007, he was married to Deborah King, daughter of blues musician Saunders King. They have three children, Salvador, Stella, and Angelica, and co-founded the Milagro (Miracle) Foundation, non-profit organization which provides financial aid for educational, medical, and other needs.

She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by \"Time\" magazine in 2018, and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed her among the 100 most powerful people in entertainment in both 2018 and 2019.</s><s>Early life. Haddish was born and raised in South Central Los Angeles, California. Her father, Tsihaye Reda Haddish, who was a refugee from Eritrea, was of Ethiopian Jewish heritage. Her mother, Leola, was an African-American small business owner, from a Christian family. After Haddish's father left when she was three years old, her mother remarried and had Haddish's two half-sisters and two half-brothers. Tiffany's sister, Jasmine English, placed 7th in the TV Show, \"Claim to Fame\", being voted out on August 15, 2022. In 1988, while her family was living in Colton, California, Haddish's mother Leola suffered severe brain damage in a car accident. It was believed to have caused Leola's schizophrenia; Haddish said her mother became quick-tempered, abusive and violent.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Haddish, then nine years old and the oldest of five siblings, became the family's primary caregiver. It was around this time that Haddish became interested in humor. She said, \"If I could make [Leola] laugh and turn her anger into some joy, I was less likely to get beat. Same thing in school: If I could make the kids laugh, they'd help me with my homework and protect me from other bullies.\" According to Haddish, her stepfather later told her he had tampered with the brakes on her mother's car, intending the wreck to kill Haddish, her siblings, and her mother so he could collect on their life insurance policies. However, the children chose to stay home that day, and the accident was not fatal for her mother.

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Lina Medina Lina Marcela Medina de Jurado (; born 23 September 1933) is a Peruvian woman who became the youngest confirmed mother in history when she gave birth on 14 May 1939, aged five years, seven months, and 21 days. Based on the medical assessments of her pregnancy, she was less than five years old when she became pregnant, which was possibly due to precocious puberty.</s><s>Early life and development. Lina Medina was born in 1933 in Ticrapo, Castrovirreyna Province, Peru, to parents Tiburelo Medina, a silversmith, and Victoria Losea. She was one of nine children. Her parents took her to a hospital in Pisco at age five due to increasing abdominal size. Doctors originally thought she had a tumor but then determined that she was in her seventh month of pregnancy. Dr Gerardo Lozada had specialists in Lima confirm the pregnancy. There was widespread interest in the case. The \"San Antonio Light\" newspaper in Texas reported in its 16 July 1939 edition that a Peruvian obstetrician and midwife association had demanded she be admitted to a national maternity hospital, and quoted reports in the Peruvian paper \"La Cr\u00f3nica\" that an American film studio had sent####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a representative \"with authority to offer the sum of $5,000 to benefit the minor\" in return for filming rights, but \"we know that the offer was rejected\". The article noted that Lozada had made films of Medina for scientific documentation and had shown them while addressing Peru's National Academy of Medicine. Some of the films had fallen into a river on a visit to the girl's hometown, but enough remained to \"intrigue the learned savants\". Six weeks after the diagnosis, on 14 May 1939, Medina gave birth to a boy by caesarean section. She was 5 years, 7 months, and 21 days old, the youngest person in history to give birth. The caesarean birth was necessitated by her small pelvis. The surgery was performed by Lozada and Dr Busalleu, with Dr Colareta providing anaesthesia. The doctors found she had fully mature sexual organs from precocious puberty. Dr. Edmundo Escomel reported her case in the medical journal \"La Presse M\u00e9dicale\", including that her menarche had occurred at eight months of age, in contrast to previous reports that she had had regular periods since the age of three or two and a half. Medina's son weighed at####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### birth and was named Gerardo after her doctor. He was raised believing Medina to be his sister before finding out at age 10 that she was his mother. After initially remaining with the family, Lozada was allowed to take custody of the son at Lozada's home in Lima. Subsequently, he employed Lina at his clinic in Lima (where she also resided), though Lina was only able to see her son occasionally. Her son grew up healthy, but died in 1979 at the age of 40 from bone marrow disease.</s><s>Identity of the father. According to Peruvian law, the mere fact of Medina's pregnancy meant that she had been raped at some point before her fifth birthday. Medina has never revealed the identity of the father nor the circumstances of her impregnation. Escomel suggests that she might not know herself, as she \"couldn't give precise responses\". Lina's father was arrested on suspicion of child sexual abuse but released due to lack of evidence.</s><s>Later life. In young adulthood, Medina worked as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Lozada, which gave her an education and helped put her son through high school. She married and had a second son in 1972. In 2002, she refused an interview####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### with Reuters, just as she had turned away many reporters in years past.</s><s>Documentation. Although it was speculated that the case was a hoax, a number of doctors over the years have verified it based on biopsies, X rays of the fetal skeleton \"in utero\", and photographs taken by the doctors caring for her. There are two published photographs documenting the case. The first was taken around the beginning of April 1939, when Medina was seven and a half months into pregnancy. Taken from her left side, it shows her standing naked in front of a neutral backdrop. It is the only published photograph taken during her pregnancy. Hers is a rare, well-documented case of extreme precocious pregnancy in a child under six.</s><s>See also. - List of youngest birth mothers - Erramatti Mangamma</s><s>References.</s><s>References.:Sources. - - - - - - - - -</s>", "Lina Medina was born on September 23, 1933 in Ticrapo, Peru.

Icardi began his footballing career at the youth teams of Vecindario and passed through La Masia, the youth system of La Liga club Barcelona, before moving to Serie A club Sampdoria to begin his professional career in 2012. After an impressive season, he joined Inter Milan in July 2013, where he developed into one of the most prolific strikers in Europe. Icardi won the \"Capocannoniere\" in both the 2014\u201315 and 2017\u201318 seasons, and was named the captain of Inter in 2015, at age 22. Three years later, Icardi was integral for Inter reaching a place in the UEFA Champions League, their first time in six years, as he became the club's eighth-highest goalscorer of all time. In 2019, Icardi signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an initial one-year loan deal, where he won a domestic treble. He then joined the club permanently in a \u20ac50 million deal. I####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####cardi made his senior debut for Argentina in October 2013 but since has played sparingly. He was controversially left out of Argentina's final squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. This has been often accredited to his marriage to Wanda Nara, whose ex-husband is Icardi's former Sampdoria teammate Maxi L\u00f3pez. L\u00f3pez and Nara divorced because of her exposed relationship with Icardi, on 2022 they broke up after she accused him of cheating.</s><s>Club career.</s><s>Club career.:Early career. Icardi was born in Rosario, Argentina and moved to Canary Islands when he was nine. He began his football career with Vecindario in Gran Canaria, and scored over 50 goals in their youth categories. In 2007, he was disputed over by Barcelona and Real Madrid, after offers from Valencia, Sevilla, Espanyol, Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, Arsenal and Liverpool. Barcelona won the race for Icardi, and signed with him until 2013. Icardi joined the Catalan club at the start of 2008\u201309 season and was included on the U-17 team. He was promoted to the U-19 team the following season before joining Sampdoria on loan in January 2011####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. Icardi later stated that leaving Barcelona was not a bad decision, convinced that his decision to move on was the right one.</s><s>Club career.:Sampdoria. On 11 January 2011, Sampdoria confirmed Icardi had signed with the club on loan until the end of the season. After a successful six-month loan for \"la Samp\", scoring 13 goals in 19 games with the Primavera team, the Italian side utilised the option to buy Icardi for \u20ac400,000 in July 2011, signing a three-year deal. In 2011\u201312 season, he scored 19 goals in the reserve league Group A, as the joint-third topscorer of the league along with Gonzalo Barreto of Group C. On 12 May 2012, he made his first-team debut, against Juve Stabia, after coming off the bench to replace Bruno Fornaroli in the 75th minute of the match. Ten minutes later, Icardi scored his first professional goal to win the match 2\u20131 for Sampdoria. On 26 September 2012, he made his Serie A debut for Sampdoria against Roma, substituting the Paraguayan midfielder Marcelo Estigarribia in the 49th minute.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### On 12 November, Icardi scored his first goal in Serie A in the Derby della Lanterna against Genoa in an eventual 3\u20131 win. On 6 January 2013, he scored two goals against Juventus in Sampdoria's 2\u20131 upset at Juventus Stadium. It was Juventus's second ever loss in the Juventus Stadium since the construction. On 27 January 2013, he scored four goals in a six-goal thrashing of fellow strugglers Pescara, lifting the Genoese side clear of the Serie A relegation zone. On 18 May, during the final match of 2012\u201313 season, Icardi scored again against Juventus, helping the team to beat the eventual champions of Italy 3\u20132 at Stadio Luigi Ferraris.</s><s>Club career.:Inter Milan. In late April, it was announced that Icardi would join Inter Milan before the beginning of the 2013\u201314 season. The deal was also later confirmed by Sampdoria board. The transfer fee was \u20ac6.5 million for 50% registration rights. Icardi was officially unveiled as an Inter player on 16 July along with Algerian striker Ishak Belfodil, where he was allocated squad number 9. He said that moving to Inter is a \"dream come####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### true\", adding that he \"had a lot of offers, but wanted only Inter\". He made his unofficial debut one day later during the 3\u20130 away win against Trentino Select XI by playing in the first half of the 3\u20130 away win. He scored his first goal for Inter in their 1\u20131 pre-season friendly draw with Bundesliga club Hamburger SV, netting after less than two minutes on the field and being assisted by Fredy Guar\u00edn.</s><s>Club career.:Inter Milan.:2013\u20132015: Debut season and \"Capocannoniere\". On 25 August 2013, Icardi made his Inter official debut, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2\u20130 home success over Genoa, hitting the crossbar late in the game; he scored his first league goal for the \"Nerazzurri\" on 14 September, netting the first of a 1\u20131 home draw against Juventus, after coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute. Due to injury, Icardi missed most of the games of the first part of the season, only returning to first-team matches in February. On 14 February 2014, during the away match against Fiorentina at Stadio Artemio Franch####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####i, Icardi returned in the field after four months and scored the winner after only ten minutes. Later, on 5 April, Icardi scored a brace during the 2\u20132 home draw against Bologna. That was his first brace of his Inter career. This was followed by another brace during the 0\u20134 away win against his former side Sampdoria. Before the match, he was booed by the home fans, but he quieted them down by scoring in the 13th minute from a cross from Palacio, making a negative gesture which saw him booked. On 10 May 2014, in Javier Zanetti's last competitive match at the San Siro, in which Inter defeated Lazio 4\u20131 to secure a place in Europa League play-off for next season, Icardi scored the second goal of the match in the 37th minute after an assist from Kova\u010di\u0107 and went to celebrate with Zanetti. He ended his first season with \"Nerazzurri\" with 23 matches in all competitions, including 22 in the league, scoring 9 goals in the process with an average of one goal in every 145 minutes. On 10 June 2014, Inter and Sampdoria reached the deal to terminate the co-ownership for####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### another \u20ac6.5 million, making Inter was the sole employer of Icardi in the football field. On 20 August 2014, in Inter's first match of the season against Iceland's Stjarnan for first leg of play-off round of the 2014\u201315 Europa League, Icardi opened a 3\u20130 away win. That was his first European goal, in his European debut. In the returning leg, he came in as a second-half substitute and scored two times in a 6\u20130 win at the San Siro, to advance his team into the group stage 9\u20130 on aggregate. During the second match of the league season on 14 September, he scored his second Serie A hat-trick in a 7\u20130 thrashing of Sassuolo. Ten days later, Icardi was injured and substituted in the 24th minute for Dani Osvaldo during the 2\u20130 home win against Atalanta. On 26 October, Icardi netted his first Serie A goal for over a month, the winner on a penalty kick against Cesena and giving Inter their first away win of the league. He was decisive again three days later, scoring a 90th-minute penalty kick won by Zdravko Kuzmanovi####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\u0107 in a 1\u20130 win against Sampdoria, giving his former side their first loss of 2014\u201315 season. On 9 November, Icardi scored twice after two assists by Palacio during a 2\u20132 home draw against Hellas Verona. This draw caused the sacking of coach Walter Mazzarri, who was replaced with the returning Roberto Mancini. On 6 January of the following year, in the first match of the second part of the season, Icardi netted the only goal for his team during the 1\u20131 draw against Juventus at Juventus Stadium; the goal came in 64th minute after a pass from the Colombian midfielder Fredy Guar\u00edn. During that match, he had a conflict with his strike partner Osvaldo who was angry with him after Icardi decided to shoot instead of passing to his teammate who was in a better position to score. Due to this, Osvaldo left the team in the end of January. Five days later, Icardi was decisive in Inter's 3\u20131 home win against Genoa, scoring the second goal and earlier making an overhead kick (saved by goalkeeper) which was turned into an assist for Palacio. In the match against Sassuolo, Inter lost 1####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\u20133 with Icardi scoring the only goal for his team after a mistake from the Sassuolo defence. After the match, he along with Guar\u00edn had a conflict with the fans at the Mapei Stadium. They went to throw their shirt to the fans who refused and threw them back at them, spewing insults at them. On 7 February, Icardi responded by scoring twice in a 3\u20130 home win against Palermo, refusing to celebrate in the process. After the match Icardi told to the media that the reason he did not celebrate was not the conflict with the fans but failing to find a way to renew his contract with the club directors. He was later criticized by Mancini for not celebrating. On 11 April, he scored the first goal during the 0\u20133 away win against Verona, helping Inter get their first win after six consecutive matches. He scored twice on the final day in a 4\u20133 win over Empoli and finished the season as the joint Serie A top goalscorer with 22 goals with Verona's Luca Toni. Although Inter failed to qualify for European competition for the second time since 1999, Icardi's form attracted attention from abroad, however he signed a new four-####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####year contract at the season's end.</s><s>Club career.:Inter Milan.:2015\u20132017: Captaincy and controversy. Before the start of 2015\u201316 season, it was announced that Icardi would be the new captain of Inter, replacing Andrea Ranocchia who lost his status after a poor 2014\u201315 season. In his first match as skipper, he was taken off after 15 minutes during the league win against Atalanta; Icardi was substituted for Stevan Joveti\u0107, who scored the winning goal in the third minute of added time. After the examinations, it was announced that Icardi suffered a thigh injury and he missed the following league match against Carpi. He made his comeback on 13 September during the 1\u20130 home win against the cross-town rivals of Milan and opened his scoring account one week later against Chievo Verona, helping Inter to clinch the 4th consecutive victory. On 27 September, Icardi was again on the scoresheet but this time in a 1\u20134 defeat versus Fiorentina, who ended Inter's undefeated streak of the 2015\u201316 season. One month later, on 28 October, following the 0\u20131 away win over Bologna where Icardi scored the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### only goal of the match following an assist from Adem Ljaji\u0107, he complained about lack of services to him, accusing his teammates in the process. Icardi told the media that: \"In ten matches I've received four chances to score, and I've taken three. I think that is a good average.\" After that, he was benched for the following league match against Roma, where Inter won, again a 1\u20130 victory. After the game, coach Mancini said that leaving Icardi on the bench was a \"tactical decision\", adding that Icardi \"must improve his game\". He returned to the starting lineup in the next league match against Torino, where Inter grabbed another 1\u20130 victory. On 22 November, in his 100th Serie A appearance, he scored in a 4\u20130 win over the minnows of Frosinone, helping Inter to seal its biggest victory of the season. On 13 December, Icardi netted his first brace of the season, in the 0\u20134 thrashing of Udinese, benefiting in both occasions from the mistakes of Udinese defenders. In Inter's final match of 2015, Icardi's goal was not enough to avoid the 2\u20131 home loss####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### against Lazio, but still the team managed to end the year in the first place. At the end of the year, Icardi was ranked the 82nd best footballer in the world by the English newspaper \"The Guardian\". On 6 January 2016, Icardi finished Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107's cross from close range for the only goal away against Empoli, putting Inter on top of Serie A. A month later, on 3 February, he scored his 50th Inter goal in all competitions in a 1\u20130 home win over Chievo, returning Inter to its winning ways after four consecutive matches. In February 2016, it was reported by several newspapers that Inter had rejected a \u20ac30 million bid from Manchester United to sign Icardi. On 9 April, he scored his 50th Serie A goal in a 1\u20130 away win over Frosinone, making his 100th Inter appearance in the process. Icardi started the season on 21 August by playing in the 2\u20130 away defeat to Chievo in the opening league match, and scored his first goal of the season a week later during the 1\u20131 draw against Palermo at home. On 11 September, Icardi scored both goals, including a last-minute####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### winner, as Inter overturn the score against newly promoted side Pescara for the first win of the season under the new coach Frank de Boer. One week later, in the Derby d'Italia match against Juventus, Icardi scored an equalizer in the 68th minute, and provided the Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 goal ten minutes later, as Inter overturn the score again to beat the lifetime rivals for the first time in league since November 2012. It was Icardi's seventh goal in eight appearances against Juventus. This was followed by a brace in Inter's 2\u20130 win at Empoli three days later, taking the lead of goalscorers table with six goals in six appearances; it was also the first time that he has scored in four consecutive Serie A matches. On 7 October, Icardi signed a new contract extension with Inter until June 2021, with a buy-out clause of \u20ac110 million. With the new deal, Icardi will earn \u20ac4,5 million per season plus various bonuses based on his performances, goals and image rights. Shortly after signing the contract, Icardi stated: \"I'm really happy to have signed this new contract that will keep me at the club until 2021. My dream is to win####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### trophies with this team. I heard lots of things during the transfer window, as you always do, but the club was on my side. I have my agent and wife Wanda to thank for this renewal and we're all pleased at home.\" Icardi scored a brace to beat Torino 2\u20131 at the San Siro, giving Inter their first win in their last 5 games. Then, he continued with his outrageous form, scoring back-to-back home braces against Crotone and Fiorentina. In the last match of 2016, Icardi scored another brace against Lazio to help Inter finish the year on a high. He finished the first part of the season with 14 goals and 5 assists, being the most efficient striker in top 5 leagues, overtaking stars such Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. The Guardian named him the world's 49th best player, winning 33 positions compared to last year ranking. On 15 January 2017, in the 3\u20131 home win against Chievo which was the fifth consecutive win in league, Icardi scored his 15th league goal of the season becoming the first Inter player to score at least 15 goals in three consecutive seasons since Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 and Christian Vieri. On 12 March,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### he scored a hat-trick against Atalanta, bringing his tally to 20 goals for the season. Icardi amassed 24 league goals in 34 appearances in the 2016\u201317 season, setting a new personal best. In Europa League, he scored twice in five matches as Inter finished last in Group K.</s><s>Club career.:Inter Milan.:2017\u20132019: Second \"Capocannoniere\" and departure. Icardi missed much of the pre-season after getting injured in May. He was ready for the start of the season, however, scoring a brace inside 15 minutes in the opening matchday against Fiorentina as Inter won 3\u20130. He repeated the feat a week later at Roma, as Inter overturned the score to win 3\u20131, the first league win at Stadio Olimpico after nine years; the goals were Icardi's first at the Olimpico as well. On 10 September, Icardi scored with penalty kick against SPAL to record his 76th Serie A goal for \"Nerazzurri\", entering in Inter's top 10 Serie A goalscorers. Later on 15 October, Icardi scored all three goals as Inter defeated cross-town rivals Milan 3\u20132 to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### put Inter in second place. He became the first player to score a hat-trick in the Derby della Madonnina since Diego Milito in May 2012. Later on throughout the season, on 18 March 2018, Icardi scored four goals, including a 14-minute hat-trick, his 6th in Serie A, against his former club, Sampdoria, to give Inter a 5\u20130 win at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Furthermore, he broke the 100 goal mark in Serie A during the same match, taking his total tally to 103 Serie A goals in his 180th Serie A appearance, becoming the 6th youngest player ever to achieve this feat, at the age of 25 years and 27 days; his fourth goal of the match was also his 100th goal for Inter, in his 172nd appearance for the club. On 22 April, Icardi scored a tap-in in the 2\u20131 away win versus Chievo which was his 26th league goal of the season, becoming the first Inter player since Angelillo in the 1958\u201359 season to achieve the feat. The next week, Icardi scored on Inter's dramatic 2\u20133 loss to Juventus, marking his 8th goal in 11 appearances against####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the Turin side. In the final championship game away versus Lazio, Icardi won and converted a penalty kick to temporally level the score in an eventual 3\u20132 win. This win placed Inter fourth in championship tied on points with Lazio but ahead on head-to-head points, meaning the club had returned to Champions League for the first time since 2012. With 29 goals, Icardi won the \"Capocannoniere\" jointly with Lazio's Ciro Immobile, breaking his previous record of 24 goals set in the previous season; he also become the first Inter player to reach this tally since Antonio Angelillo during the 1958\u201359 season (33 goals). Icardi began the new season in slow form, failing to score in the opening six championship matches. He also missed the away game against Bologna due to injury. Icardi played his first match in the UEFA Champions League on 18 September in Inter's opening Group B game against Tottenham Hotspur, netting a late equalizer with a 20-yard volley in an eventual 2\u20131 home win. His strike was named Champions League Goal of the Week. In the second game away at PSV Eindhoven, Icardi was on the score-sheet again####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### by netting a tap-in after taking the ball around goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet to give Inter a second 2\u20131 comeback win. By doing so Icardi become the first Inter player since Adriano in 2004\u201305 season to score in each of his first two Champions League matches. By scoring a brace in Inter's 2\u20131 win at SPAL, Icardi reached 103 Serie A goals by matching Christian Vieri tally as the seventh player with the most Serie A goals scored with Inter. In the first game following the international break, Icardi played and scored the game-winner against Milan to make it five league wins in a row for Inter, also scoring the club's 300th goal in the Derby della Madonnina. Icardi made his 200th Serie A appearance on 24 November by playing in the last 13 minutes of a 3\u20130 home win over Frosinone. On 13 February 2019, because of several comments that Icardi's wife and agent, Wanda Nara, made about Inter's management and its players on the TV program \"Tiki Taka\", Inter announced that he was to be replaced by Samir Handanovi\u0107 as club captain. In response to being stripped of the captaincy####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, Icardi refused to play in the club's UEFA Europa League match against Rapid Wien the following day. He returned in action on 3 April in the league match against Genoa, 53 days since his last appearance; on his return, Icardi scored a penalty after being fouled inside the penalty area by Cristian Romero, who received a straight red card. In the second half, he also set up Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 goal before making way for Keita Balde in 80th minute.

In April 2012, Icardi received a call-up from Italy under-19 squad to play in the friendly against England, but the player refused to accept the invitation as he wanted to play for Argentina.

Icardi scored his first goal with Argentina U20 on 19 August in a 2\u20130 win over Japan, which was followed by another two in the 2\u20131 win against Turkey three days later. The tournament ended in conquest, as Icardi was the top scorer with three goals.</s><s>International career.:Senior. Following Italy national football team manager Cesare Prandelli's interest in Icardi's performances, in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### February 2013, Icardi stated his wish to play for the Argentina senior team, despite also being eligible to play for Italy, saying: \"I'm very grateful to Italian football for the opportunity it has given me, I'd also like to thank Prandelli for the nice words he expressed about me. But I have to be honest and sincere \u2013 I'm Argentine, I feel Argentine, and I've always dreamed of wearing the shirt of my nation. To actually do that would be the maximum for me.\" On 15 October 2013, he played his first game for the main squad, coming on as an 82nd-minute substitute for Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez in a 2\u20133 FIFA World Cup qualifier loss away to Uruguay. In April 2016, Icardi was excluded from Gerardo Martino's preliminary squad for the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, although the Argentine manager later named him to Argentina's preliminary under-23 squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. However, Inter did not release Icardi to participate in the Olympics. In October 2016, rumours started to speculate in Argentina that Lionel Messi was behind Icardi's exclusion from the national team due to Messi's friendship with Maxi L\u00f3pez, Icardi's wife####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####'s former partner. The national team coach Edgardo Bauza stated that Icardi's off-field antics have nothing to do with him not being selected for Argentina and he would receive a call-up soon, adding that Messi does not \"dictate\" the team. However, he was omitted again for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against Brazil and Colombia in November. On 19 May 2017, Icardi received his first call-up after more than three years by newly appointed coach Jorge Sampaoli for the friendlies against Brazil and Singapore in June. In May 2018, Icardi was named in Argentina's preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Later that month, however, he was left out from the final 23. Icardi scored his first senior international goal on 20 November 2018, in a 2\u20130 friendly home win over Mexico. His goal, scored after just 71 seconds, was the fourth quickest goal in Argentina history. In this match, he won the first trophy with the senior team - Copa Adidas 2018. In May 2019, Icardi was included in Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni's preliminary 40-man squad for the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica. Later that month, however, he####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### was excluded from the final 23-man squad for the tournament.</s><s>Style of play. Nicknamed \"El ni\u00f1o del partido\", Icardi is a quick, tactically intelligent, and physically strong striker, with good technique. Known for his excellent attacking movement, positioning, an eye for goal, he mainly operates in central areas inside the penalty box; an accurate and efficient finisher with his head and either foot inside the area, he is known for his ability to score from few touches, although he can also hold up the ball in order to create space or chances for other players, and play off of his teammates. Although he was once criticised for his limited creative and defensive contribution, as well as his lack of significant pace, stamina, power, and movement outside the box, his work-rate has improved in recent seasons, and has seen him drift out to wide positions in order to create space or provide assists for teammates. Long regarded as a talented and promising prospect, in 2013, Don Bal\u00f3n listed him as one of the top 100 young players born after 1992. Speaking of Icardi, Inter coach Stefano Pioli stated that Icardi \"is an animal in the box\", and \"always finding the right position\", while the 1982####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### FIFA World Cup winner Paolo Rossi described Icardi as a \"deadly striker\", adding that \"even in the most complicated games he can create the right opportunity and take advantage of it.\" Inter manager Luciano Spalletti called him \"a complete striker\" adding that \"for his age shoulders so much responsibility\". In an interview in January 2015, Icardi said his role model is Gabriel Batistuta, but during his time at Barcelona, he added that the forward he mostly resembled was Samuel Eto'o.</s><s>Personal life. Icardi is married to Argentine media personality Wanda Nara. Nara was married to Icardi's former Sampdoria teammate Maxi L\u00f3pez, but the couple split after her relationship with Icardi was exposed. She and L\u00f3pez began divorce proceedings in December 2013. Nara and Icardi subsequently married on 27 May 2014, not long after the divorce was finalised, at a small ceremony in Buenos Aires. They have two daughters, Francesca, born on 19 January 2015, and Isabella, born on 27 October 2016. The marriage to Wanda provoked animosity against Icardi in Argentina, making him a target of rumors and unsubstantiated claims by Argentinian tabloids.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### It has been argued that the generalized hatred against him has been an important factor against his being called to the national team, and even prospective calls have been heavily criticized by figures such as the late Diego Maradona, who had entangled in bitter exchanges with Icardi on Twitter as a result of his marriage to Nara. During an April 2014 Serie A match between Sampdoria and Inter, L\u00f3pez notably refused to shake Icardi's hand, leading the press to dub the game the \"Wanda derby\". Two years later, L\u00f3pez repeated the story by again refusing to shake Icardi's hand during a Serie A match against Torino. Icardi is of partial Italian origin through his paternal ancestors named Icardi from Piedmont and Da Mezan from Venice. He has an Italian passport. He features on the cover of the Italian version of EA Sports' \"FIFA 16\", alongside global cover star and compatriot Lionel Messi. On 6 December 2015, Icardi was robbed of his \u00a329,000 Hublot watch after Inter's 1\u20130 win over Genoa. On 11 October 2016, Icardi released his autobiography called \"Sempre Avanti\" (Always Forward) published by Sperling & Kup####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####fer. The book caused controversy as Icardi had described an incident which offended certain Inter fans, leading to a banner being displayed calling for Icardi to leave the club.

In the 2016\u201317 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful title bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists.

Salah frequently had to miss school to make the 3 hour journey to training. When Salah was 15 he was noticed by then first team manager Mohamed Radwan, who moved him to the senior squad immediately. Salah had to be given a special diet and training program due to his muscles not being fully formed because of his young age.</s><s>Club career.:Al Mokawloon.:2010\u201312: Senior team appearances.

Swiss Super League club Basel had been monitoring Salah for some time, so following the Egyptian Premier League suspension, the club organised a friendly match with the Egypt U-23 team. The match took place on 16 March at the Stadion Rankhof in Basel, and despite only playing the second half, Salah scored twice, helping the Egyptians to a 4\u20133 win. Basel subsequently invited Salah to remain in the city for a week's training. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that Salah had signed for Basel on####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### a four-year contract starting from 15 June 2012. He initially found it difficult to settle, having arrived unable to speak the language and been signed as a replacement for fan-favourite Xherdan Shaqiri (whom he would later play alongside at Liverpool). Salah scored on his unofficial debut on 23 June 2012 against Steaua Bucure\u0219ti during a friendly match, a 4\u20132 defeat.

Salah scored in his first league appearance of the season against Aarau on 13 July 2013. He scored his first Champions League goal a month later against Maccabi Tel Aviv on 6 August 2013 in the third qualifying round. Salah was the subject of major controversy following the game, after he appeared to deliberately avoid shaking hands with the players of the Israeli club in both the home and away legs. He scored twice against the Bulgarian league champions PFC Ludogorets Razgrad on 21 August 2013 in the play-off round. On 18 September 2013, Salah scored the equaliser against Chelsea in the 2\u20131 away win during the group stage.

Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldo \u2013 whom Salah idolized while growing up \u2013 stated, \"Salah is an incredible player with a tremendous quality. He looks like Messi.\" Salah has also received praise for his refusal to celebrate against his former clubs.</s><s>Personal life. Salah and his wife, Maggi, married in 2013. Their daughter, Makka, born in 2014, is named in honour of the Islamic holy city of Mecca. He had another daughter, Kayan, born in 2020. Salah is Muslim and celebrates goals by performing the sujud. On this goal celebration, Salah told CNN, \"It's something like praying or thanking God for what I have received, but yeah, it's just praying and praying for a win. I've always done that since I was young, everywhere.\"{{cite news |title=Watch: Seven-year-old draws inspiration from Mo Salah for goal celebration |url=https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/daily/2018/05/24/news/watch-seven-year-old-draws-inspiration-from-mo-salah####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-for-goal-celebration-1338360/ Salah enjoys playing football on his PlayStation, and has confessed jokingly that \"Salah in the video game is stronger than the real one\".{{cite news |title=5 facts that will help you to know Mo Salah a little bit closer |url=https://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2020-03-06-5-facts-that-wil-help-you-to-know-mo-salah-a-little-bit-closer/ During the 2018 Egyptian presidential election, a large number of spoilt ballot papers, possibly more than a million, involved voters crossing out both names and writing Salah's name instead. In November 2020, Salah tested positive for COVID-19.</s><s>Outside football.</s><s>Outside football.:Sponsors. Salah has a sponsorship deal with sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas: he wears Adidas X18 football boots. He appeared in an Adidas 2018 World Cup commercial along with other players in the Adidas stable, including David Beckham, Lionel Messi and Paul Pogba, and singer Pharrell Williams. In March 2018, Salah appeared in an advertisement for Vodafone####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Egypt. Filmed visiting several Merseyside landmarks, the video was originally released in Arabic (but was also translated to English). A month later, he mentioned that he was \"insulted\" after his image was displayed across the national team's plane without his permission before the start of the World Cup that year, as the official sponsor of the national team, WE, is a rival of his sponsor.</s><s>Outside football.:Charity. Salah is active in regeneration projects in Nagrig, his hometown where 65% of people live in poverty, donating money to help build a school and hospital. The project includes the construction of an Al-Azhar institute and an ambulance unit. In an interview with \"Al-Masry Al-Youm\", Salah's father claimed that his son refused to accept any financial assistance with the project. During his time in Egypt, Salah's family was once robbed, however, the thief was caught and arrested by police, with Salah's father preparing to press charges against him, but Mohamed convinced him to drop the case. Afterwards, Salah helped the thief financially, giving him some money and trying to find him a job. In February 2018, following a match against Tottenham, Salah donated a replica shirt to young####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### supporter Mohamed Abdel Karim, who was previously pictured wearing a jumper reading Salah's name and shirt number. Moreover, Mohamed Salah has helped more than 450 families by giving them monthly allowances and he also helped the government by giving approximately $300,000 when the country was experiencing an economic crisis. On 13 August 2022, a fire broke out at Abu Sefein Church in Giza, Egypt, with 41 people losing their lives as a result. Salah subsequently expressed his condolences on Twitter, and made a donation of three million Egyptian pounds to help rebuild the church.</s><s>In popular culture. The most popular chant for Salah was made by Liverpool supporters where they called him the Egyptian King \u2013 \u201cMo Salah! Mo Salah! Mo Salah! Running down the wing. Mo Salah la-la-la la-ahh, The Egyptian King!\u201d, they also created another chant to the tune of Dodgy's \"Good Enough\", saying that if Salah continued to score goals, they would convert to Islam \u2013 \"If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me, if he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too.\" Salah has given his approval to the chant, and it has been cited####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### as an example of inclusivity. According to a 2021 study in the \"American Political Science Review\", Salah's transfer to Liverpool led to a 16% reduction in hate crimes in the city, as well as reducing Islamophobic online rhetoric by Liverpool fans. Salah is devout to a degree that many other well-known Muslims sports figures are not, and his charm and apolitical persona have made him a popular figure in the UK. During his goal celebration, Salah lays in the prostrate position to thank God in sujud. Salah is nicknamed \"The Pharaoh\" by the press and his fans. He has also been given the nickname \"Egyptian King\" by Liverpool supporters, arising from a chant set to the tune of \"Sit Down\" by English indie rock band James. Following his goal that led Egypt to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1990, a school in Egypt was named after him. Following Egypt's exit from the World Cup, Salah stayed in his home country for his pre-season holiday. In late June, his address was accidentally leaked on Facebook. After this, crowds of fans showed up at Salah's house, with Salah greeting the fans and signing autographs for some, although according to reports in Spain, police####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### did arrive to cordon off his house. During Liverpool's 2018 pre-season tour in the U.S., American artist Brandan Odums created a mural in the Times Square area displaying Salah in the Egypt kit, with the player later posting an image on social media posing next to it. In Egypt, several murals have also been created displaying Salah's likeness, including one in the capital of Cairo. A testament to his influence in the region and globally, Salah was featured on the cover of two major magazines in 2018: \"GQ\" Middle East (feature story titled \"The Unstoppable Rise of Mo Salah\") and \"Time\" magazine's 2019 TIME 100 edition. An advocate of women's equality in the Middle East, Salah (in his TIME 100 entry) states, \"We need to change the way we treat women in our culture\". English comedian, and noted Liverpool fan, John Oliver wrote Salah's feature in the TIME 100 issue. Oliver notably started the feature writing \"Mo Salah is a better human being than he is a football player. And he\u2019s one of the best football players in the world.\" Despite being named as the \"GQ Middle East Man of The Year\" in 2019, another GQ####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### photoshoot, with Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio, caused him some criticism in the Islamic world. In January 2020, Salah was honoured with a wax statue at Madame Tussauds in London. The museum announced that the statue would be unveiled later in the year. \u201cAs Egyptian forward and currently both European and World Club champion with Liverpool F.C., Mo Salah is a global star at the peak of his power. We know that fans will love seeing him at the home of celebrity, where he rightly belongs,\u201d Steve Davies, General Manager at Madame Tussauds in London said.</s><s>Career statistics.</s><s>Career statistics.:Club.</s><s>Career statistics.:International.</s><s>Honours.

He has won multiple world championships in four weight classes from light middleweight to light heavyweight, including unified titles in three of those weight classes and lineal titles in two. \u00c1lvarez is the first and only boxer in history to become undisputed champion at super middleweight, having held the WBA (Super), WBC and \"Ring\" magazine titles since 2020, and the IBF and WBO titles since 2021. \u00c1lvarez is known as an excellent counterpuncher, being able to exploit openings in his opponents' guards while avoiding punches with head and body movement. He is also known as a formidable body puncher. As of May 2022, \u00c1lvarez is ranked as the world's best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec and the Boxing Writers Association of America; fourth by ESPN; fifth by the TBRB; and sixth by \"The Ring\". He is also ranked as the world's best active super middleweight by BoxRec, \"The Ring\", TBRB, and ESPN.</s><s>Early life. In an interview, \u00c1lv####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####arez explained that he was born on the outskirts of Guadalajara, Jalisco, but his family is originally from Los Reyes, Michoac\u00e1n. At the age of five, his family moved to their current home of Juanacatl\u00e1n, Jalisco. Growing up on his family's farm, he learned horseback riding, which he continues today. \u00c1lvarez is the youngest of eight children, seven of them boys; all of his brothers also became professional boxers. Among his brothers are welterweight boxers Ram\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez, Ricardo \u00c1lvarez and former WBA interim world champion, Rigoberto \u00c1lvarez. \"Canelo\" in Spanish is the masculine word for cinnamon, which is a common nickname for people with red hair. His mother, Ana Maria, also has red hair. In Mexico, it is common for people to associate red hair with the Irish soldiers who fought for Mexico in the Saint Patrick's Battalion during the Mexican\u2013American War. Speaking about his ancestry, \u00c1lvarez once said, \"There might have been an Irish grandfather somewhere back in my past.\" He was bullied at an early age when he would be called \"J\u00edcama con Chile\", which translates as jicama####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### with chilli flakes \u2013 a popular snack in Mexico.</s><s>Amateur career. \u00c1lvarez started boxing when he was around 13 years old, after watching his older brother Rigoberto debut as a professional boxer. In 2004, he won the silver medal at the Junior Mexican National Championships, held in Sinaloa. He became the 2005 Junior Mexican National Boxing Champion in Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, Chiapas, at the age of 15. His amateur record was 44\u20132 with 12 knockouts.</s><s>Professional career.</s><s>Professional career.:Early years. \u00c1lvarez turned professional at 15, shortly after his championship at the Junior Nationals, because his trainers at the time, father-and-son team Chepo and Eddy Reynoso, were unable to find suitable junior opponents for him. In his first 19 months as a professional, he knocked out eleven of his 13 documented opponents, all of whom were significantly older. However, the elder Reynoso stated in 2013 that \u00c1lvarez had fought ten more times in that span, winning all ten by knockout (KO), but that these fights (all in small venues in the Mexican state of Nayarit) were so poorly documented that it was not worth the trouble to seek####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to have the record corrected. This means that his actual record is 67\u20132\u20132 with 49 knockouts. His weight fluctuated in his three years as a professional including two documented fights within the light welterweight limit of 140\u00a0lbs before he settled in the welterweight division at 147\u00a0lbs. \u00c1lvarez's third official bout of his career was a win over future IBF lightweight champion Miguel V\u00e1zquez on 20 January 2006, in his home town of Guadalajara, Jalisco. On 28 June 2008, \u00c1lvarez defeated V\u00e1zquez again in a rematch. He also made world history on that fight card when he and all six of his brothers fought on the same night, with Canelo being the youngest.{{cite journal</s><s>Professional career.:Light middleweight. His sixth-round technical knockout (TKO) win over Luciano Leonel Cuello for the WBC Silver light middleweight title was held at the Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez Arena. During the post-fight interview, Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez gave \u00c1lvarez a horse. He was also given a horse by the mayor of Tepic, where \u00c1lvarez sometimes trains. He next faced the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### former WBC welterweight champion Carlos Baldomir at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, on the Shane Mosley vs. Sergio Mora undercard. Baldomir stated in a pre-fight interview that he wanted the winner of Mora vs. Mosley, as he said \"after I knock out El Canelo.\" Baldomir weighed in at 153.4\u00a0lbs for the bout, that was contracted for 151\u00a0lbs.

In front of 39,247 fans, \u00c1lvarez successfully defended his WBC light middleweight title and won both the WBA (Regular) and vacant \"Ring\" light middleweight titles. During the first few rounds, Trout seemed to have a good game plan. However, \u00c1lvarez's power took over after the third round, eventually scoring a knockdown in the seventh round to give Trout the first knockdown of his career. \u00c1lvarez set up the knockdown with a pawing left jab, followed by the straight right hand. The fight was closer than expected, but \u00c1lvarez still managed to dominate Trout throughout the fight with impressive head movement and shocking power.

In March, ESPN reported the fight would take place at a catchweight of 155\u00a0lbs, due to \u00c1lvarez not being able to make the light middleweight limit of 154\u00a0lbs. For the PPV fight, \u00c1lvarez agreed to pay $100,000 of his minimum $1.25 million purse to Angulo, which would raise his purse $850,000. Also in the negotiations, \u00c1lvarez agreed to weigh no more than 168\u00a0lbs on fight night. This was \u00c1lvarez's first of five fights which took place at the 155-pound catchweight. On fight night, \u00c1lvarez weighed 174\u00a0lbs on Showtime's scale and Angulo weighed 170\u00a0lbs. In front of 14,610 at the MGM, \u00c1lvarez came out strong, throwing combinations.

The final scorecard was controversial as many observers considered it far too wide. According to CompuBox, Lara landed 55 jabs to nine from \u00c1lvarez, who landed the jab at a five percent connect rate. \u00c1lvarez managed to land 88 power punches while Lara landed 53 power punches. Lara's clean punching, defense and movement were weighed against \u00c1lvarez's effective aggressiveness and power punching. Lara came out in dominant fashion, utilizing a stick-and-move style and capturing the early rounds. Although \u00c1lvarez struggled with Lara's one-two combinations, Lara's punches weren't thrown with sufficient power or frequency to dissuade him from consistently pressing the fight against a retreating Lara, and he was able to hammer away to Lara's####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### body when he had him on the ropes. Lara's lead hand played a huge role in his one-two combination's effectiveness, but his output dropped as the fight progressed and he became increasingly tentative. \u00c1lvarez was able to cut Lara with a lead left uppercut in the seventh round.

The championship rounds were arguably the best rounds and \u00c1lvarez started to counter more and both fighters stood toe####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-to-toe exchanging swings, the majority of which missed. The draw saw Golovkin make his 19th consecutive defense, just one behind middleweight great Bernard Hopkins. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin was the busier of the two, landing 218 of 703 thrown (31%), while \u00c1lvarez was more accurate, landing 169 of his 505 thrown (34%). Golovkin out landed \u00c1lvarez in ten of the twelve rounds. The replay, which took place a week later on HBO averaged 726,000, peaking at 840,000 viewers. Speaking to Max Kellerman after the fight, Golovkin said, \"It was a big drama show. [The scoring] is not my fault. I put pressure on him every round. Look, I still have all the belts. I am still the champion.\" \u00c1lvarez felt as though he won the fight, \"In the first rounds, I came out to see what he had. Then I was building from there. I think I won eight rounds. I felt that I won the fight. I think I was superior in the ring. I won at least seven or eight rounds. I was able to counterpunch and made Gennady wobble at####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### least three times. If we fight again, it's up to the people. I feel frustrated over my draw.\" Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez believed judge Byrd had her scorecard filled out before the first bell rang. \u00c1lvarez ruled out another fight in 2017, claiming he would return on Cinco de Mayo weekend in May 2018. At the post-fight press conference, \u00c1lvarez said through a translator, \"Look, right now I wanna rest. Whatever the fans want, whatever the people want and ask for, we\u2019ll do. You know that\u2019s my style. But right now, who knows if it\u2019s in May or September? But one thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 this is my era, the era of Canelo\". Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler stated that they would like an immediate rematch, but Golovkin, who prefers fighting at least three times in a calendar year, reiterated his desire to also fight in December. The fight surpassed Mayweather\u2013\u00c1lvarez to achieve the third highest gate in boxing history. ESPN reported the fight generated $27,059,850 from 17,318 tickets sold. 934 complimentary tickets were given out, according to the NSAC####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. Mayweather vs. \u00c1lvarez sold 16,146 tickets to produce a live gate of $20,003,150. The replay, which took place a week later on HBO averaged 726,000, peaking at 840,000 viewers. The LA Times reported the fight generated 1.3 million domestic PPV buys. Although HBO didn't make an official announcement, it is believed that the revenue would exceed $100 million.</s><s>Professional career.:Middleweight.:\u00c1lvarez vs. Golovkin II. Immediately after the controversial ending, talks began for a rematch between \u00c1lvarez and Golovkin. \u00c1lvarez stated he would next fight in May 2018, whereas Golovkin was open to fighting in December 2017. ESPN reported that \u00c1lvarez, who only had the rematch clause in his contract, must activate it within three weeks of their fight. On 19 September, Golden Boy Promotions president Eric Gomez told ESPN that everyone on their side was interested in the rematch and they would hold discussions with Tom Loeffler in the coming days. Ringtv reported that the negotiations would begin on 22 September. On 24 September, Gomez said the rematch would likely take place in the first week of May 2018 or as early as March####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### if a deal could be worked. Despite ongoing negotiations for the rematch, at the 55th annual convention in Baku, Azerbaijan on 2 October, the WBC officially ordered a rematch. Gomez reacted by telling ESPN, \"Regardless of if they did or didn't order the rematch, we are going to try to make it happen. We'll do whatever it takes to make it happen.\" On 7 November, Gomez indicated the negotiations were going well and \u00c1lvarez would make a decision in regards to the rematch in the following weeks. It was believed that Golden Boy would wait until after David Lemieux and Billy Joe Saunders fought for the latter's WBO title on 16 December 2017, before making a decision. On 15 November, Matchroom's Eddie Hearn, promoter of Daniel Jacobs, stated that he approached Tom Loeffler regarding a possible rematch between Golovkin and Jacobs if the \u00c1lvarez\u2013Golovkin rematch failed to take place. On 20 December, Gomez announced that the negotiations were close to being finalized after \u00c1lvarez gave Golden Boy the go-ahead to write up the contracts. On 29 January 2018, HBO finally announced the rematch would take place in May on Cinco de Mayo weekend. On 22 February, the T####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-Mobile Arena was again selected as the fight's venue. According to WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman, \u00c1lvarez would fight Golovkin for their title this time around. In March 2018, \u00c1lvarez tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol ahead of the fight. Adding to the controversy, Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez claimed that \u00c1lvarez had his hands wrapped in an illegal manner for the first fight. On 23 March, the NSAC temporarily suspended \u00c1lvarez due to his two positive tests for the banned substance clenbuterol. \u00c1lvarez was required to appear at a commission hearing, either in person or via telephone, on the issue on 10 April. The commission would decide at the hearing whether the fight would be permitted to go ahead as scheduled. On 28 March, MGM Resorts International, who own the T-Mobile Arena, started to offer full refunds to anyone who had already purchased tickets for the bout. They wrote, \"In the event a fan requested a refund, they could get one at the original point of sale and in full.\" The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported the news. The hearing was rescheduled for 18 April, as Bob Bennett filed a complaint against \u00c1lv####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####arez. On 3 April, \u00c1lvarez officially withdrew from the rematch. Golden Boy mentioned during a press conference it was hinted that \u00c1lvarez would likely not be cleared at the hearing and they would not have enough time to promote the fight. On 13 April, an unofficial source stated that \u00c1lvarez had checked into a private hospital in Guadalajara for an arthroscopy knee surgery. A spokesperson for Golden Boy later said it was a cosmetic surgery. After surgery, \u00c1lvarez posted a picture on social media with a caption reading, \"I share that today I had to undergo an arthroscopic surgery to repair the internal femoral cartilage and eliminate a pathological fold of my right knee.\" Eric Gomez of Golden Boy later confirmed that \u00c1lvarez had \"a cyst taken out of his knee\" and there were no serious issues with his knee. At the hearing, \u00c1lvarez was given a six-month suspension, backdated to his first drug test fail on 17 February, meaning the ban would end on 17 August 2018. The Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) stated that \u00c1lvarez was not enrolled in their testing program. His promoter De La Hoya then announced that \u00c1####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####lvarez would return to the ring on Mexican Independence Day weekend. According to Golovkin on 27 April, before he defeated Vanes Martirosyan, a fight with \u00c1lvarez in the fall was still a priority. During a conference call, he stated it was the \"biggest fight in the world\" and beneficial for all parties involved. Although Golovkin stated the rematch had a ten percent chance of happening, Eric Gomez and Tom Loeffler agreed to meet and start negotiating after 5 May. One of the main issues preventing the rematch to take place was the purse split. \u00c1lvarez wanted 65\u201335 in his favor, the same terms Golovkin agreed to initially, however Golovkin wanted a straight 50\u201350 split. On 6 June, Golovkin was stripped of his IBF title due to not adhering to the IBF's rules. The IBF granted Golovkin an exception to fight Martirosyan, although they would not sanction the fight and told Golovkin's team to start negotiating and fight mandatory challenger Sergiy Derevyanchenko by 3 August 2018. The IBF released a statement in detail explaining its decision to strip Golovkin of the belt. On 7 June,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Golovkin's team stated they would accept a 55\u201345 split in favor of \u00c1lvarez. Five days later on 12 June, Golden Boy gave Golovkin a 24-hour deadline to accept a 57\u00bd\u201342\u00bd split in \u00c1lvarez's favor or they would explore other fights. At this time, Golden Boy were already in light negotiations with Eddie Hearn for a fight against Daniel Jacobs instead. At the same time, Loeffler was working closely with Frank Warren to match Saunders with Golovkin at the end of August. Golovkin declined the offer and De La Hoya stated there would be no rematch. Despite this, some sources indicated both sides were still negotiating after a \"Hail Mary\" idea came to light. Hours later, De La Hoya confirmed via his Twitter account that terms had been agreed and the fight would indeed take place on 15 September at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Golovkin revealed to ESPN he agreed to 45%. \u00c1lvarez started training for the bout on 14 June and stated his intention to apply for his boxing license on 18 August. It was confirmed that both boxers would not physically come face to face with each other until the fight week. A split-####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####screen press conference took place on 3 July. On 3 September, due to a majority vote of the panel, it was announced that the vacant \"Ring\" middleweight title would be contested for the bout. Doug Fischer wrote, \"We posed the question to the ratings panel, which, in a landslide, voted in favor the magazine\u2019s 160-pound championship being up for grabs when the two stars clash at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\" In front of a sell out crowd of 21,965, the fight was again not without controversy as \u00c1lvarez defeated Golovkin via majority decision after twelve rounds. \u00c1lvarez was favored by judges Dave Moretti and Steve Weisfeld, both scoring the bout 115\u2013113, the third judge Glenn Feldman scored it 114\u2013114. The result was disputed by fans, pundits and media. Of the 18 media outlets scoring the bout, ten ruled in favor of Golovkin, seven scored a draw while one scored the bout for \u00c1lvarez. The scorecards showed how close the bout was, with the judges splitting eight rounds. After nine rounds, all three judges had their scorecards reading 87\u201384 for \u00c1lvarez. The fight was much different from the first bout in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### terms of action. \u00c1lvarez who was described by Golovkin's team as a \"runner\", altered his style and became more aggressive. Both boxers found use of their respective jabs from the opening round with Golovkin using his jab more as the fight went on. Big punches were landed by both fighters during the bout, with both \u00c1lvarez and Golovkin showing excellent chins. Despite the tense build up, both boxers showed each other respect after the fight. \u00c1lvarez made good use of his body attack, landing 46 compared to Golovkin's six landed. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin landed 234 of 879 punches thrown (27%) and \u00c1lvarez landed 202 of his 622 punches (33%). Golovkin had the edge in jabs, landing 118 out of 547 (21.6%) compared to 59 out of 256 (23%) for \u00c1lvarez. However, \u00c1lvarez had the edge in power punches, landing 143 out of 366 (39.1%) compared to 116 out of 332 (34.9%) for Golovkin. In eight of the rounds Golovkin outlanded \u00c1lvarez in total punches whereas \u00c1lvarez####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### outlanded him in power punches in 9 of the rounds. \u00c1lvarez stated that the fight was a \"clear victory\" and that \"in the end, it was a victory for Mexico. And again, it was an opportunity. And I want to shout out to my opponent, the best in the sport of boxing. I am a great fighter, and I showed it tonight. If the people want another round, I'll do it again. But for right now, I will enjoy time with my family.\" Golovkin did not take part in the post-fight and made his way backstage where he received stitches for a cut over his right eye. He later responded to the defeat, explaining that \"I'm not going to say who won tonight, because the victory belongs to Canelo, according to the judges. I thought it was a very good fight for the fans and very exciting. I thought I fought better than he did.\" Both fighters were open to a trilogy. The fight generated a live gate of $23,473,500 from 16,732 tickets sold. This was lower than the first bout, but still the fourth largest-grossing gates in Nevada boxing history. The fight sold 1.1 million PPV buys, lower than the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### first bout; however, due to being priced at $84.95, it generated more revenue at around $94 million.</s><s>Professional career.:Super middleweight.</s><s>Professional career.:Super middleweight.:\u00c1lvarez vs. Fielding. In October 2018, \u00c1lvarez announced that he would move up to the super middleweight division for the first time in his career to fight 31-year-old British boxer Rocky Fielding (27\u20131, 15 KOs) at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York on 15 December 2018, for the WBA (Regular) super middleweight title. On 17 October 2018, DAZN announced that it had signed a five-year, $365 million deal with \u00c1lvarez, under which his next eleven fights would be broadcast in the U.S. by the subscription sports streaming service. The deal would begin with \u00c1lvarez vs. Fielding and replace his expired contract with HBO (which had also announced its discontinuation of boxing telecasts). \u00c1lvarez won the one-sided bout via third-round technical knockout after repeatedly downing Fielding with body shots.

On 13 September 2019, \u00c1lvarez announced via social media that he would move up two weight classes to challenge WBO light heavyweight titleholder Sergey Kovalev on 2 November 2019, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. After a competitive first ten rounds in which Kovalev found success with his jab while \u00c1lvarez largely utilized power punches, the latter produced a left hook, straight right combination to stop Kovalev in the eleventh round to become a four-division world champion. At the time of the stoppage, \u00c1lvarez led 96\u201394 on two of the judges####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####' scorecards, with the other scorecard even at 95\u201395. He joined Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Mike McCallum as the only former junior middleweight champions in history to win a title at light heavyweight. Among them, only Hearns, Leonard, and Alvarez himself established their careers at welterweight and claimed the title at the 175 pound limit. After the fight, Kovalev suggested that he had always been unlikely to win the fight, due to the grueling schedule of back-to-back training camps which resulted from the short period of time between fighting Anthony Yarde on 24 August and \u00c1lvarez on 2 November, but he had agreed to fight the latter regardless due to the high financial incentive, reported to be $12 million. \u00c1lvarez himself was reported to have received a purse of $35 million for the fight. \u00c1lvarez responded by calling Kovalev a \"bad loser\". For his 2019 campaign, \u00c1lvarez was named the fighter of the year by The Ring Magazine, ESPN, Sports Illustrated, and the Boxing Writers Association of America.</s><s>Professional career.:Return to super middleweight.

The bout attracted criticism due to many perceiving Y\u0131ld\u0131####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####r\u0131m, who had not been in the ring since he lost a technical split decision to Anthony Dirrell two years prior in February 2019, to be vastly over-matched. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m had been named to the mandatory position as a result of the controversial nature of his loss to Dirrell, however, he had remained sidelined due to injury and the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00c1lvarez, who was mandated to face Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m in order to retain the WBC title despite being heavily favored, was dismissive of the critics, saying \"I really don\u2019t have to give any explanation because they\u2019re never gonna be happy with anything...

Prior to the fight, there was a dispute between the two fighters' camps regarding the size of the ring: Saunders was unhappy with the proposed 18-foot ring. He instead wanted a 24-foot ring and threatened to pull out of the fight if his request wasn't met, despite having boxed primarily in 20-foot rings in his bouts in the past in the United Kingdom. He ultimately settled for a 22-foot ring after \u00c1lvarez said, \u201cI don\u2019t care about the size of the ring, I\u2019m just gonna go in there and do my job. It\u2019####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####s not the only excuse he\u2019s had. He\u2019s had plenty of excuses,\" referencing when Saunders had previously voiced his concerns about the selection of judges for the fight. In front of a record breaking crowd of 73,126 for boxing attendance at an indoor facility in the United States, \u00c1lvarez won via eighth-round corner retirement when Saunders' team threw in the towel due to Saunders having suffered a fractured orbital bone as a result of an uppercut landed by \u00c1lvarez. At the time of the stoppage, \u00c1lvarez was winning on the scorecards 78\u201374 (twice) and 77\u201375. Throughout the fight, \u00c1lvarez outlanded Saunders 73 to 60 in total punches and landed 53% of his power punches. In the immediate post-fight press conference, \u00c1lvarez was confronted by undefeated WBO middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade who asked him when they were going to fight, before accusing \u00c1lvarez of ducking him. \u00c1lvarez responded to him in English dismissively, calling him a \"horrible fighter\", and criticizing his resume: \"Man, you fight with nobody. You are a champion but you fight with nobody.\" Before Andrade was removed####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### from the press conference, \u00c1lvarez told him, \"Get the fuck outta here.

On 21 September 2021, the two fighters were engaged in a brief onstage scuffle during their first press conference, in which \u00c1lvarez initiated physical contact during their face-off when he shoved Plant. \u00c1lvarez stated that he had done this because he took offense to Plant's use of the word \"motherfucker\", interpreting it as an insult to his mother. Plant denied to reporters that he had used the common American curse word in that context. Moreover, he drew attention to \u00c1lvarez's hypocrisy, accurately indicating that \ufffd####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\ufffdlvarez had previously used the same slur against Demetrius Andrade on the night of 8 May 2021 in the aftermath of his fight against Billy Joe Saunders in Arlington, Texas.

He had knocked his opponent to the canvas with a left hook right uppercut combination in the penultimate round, before closing in to drop Plant again, prompting referee Russell Mora to call off the bout.

The cruiserweight limit was 200 pounds, but it had recently been reduced to 190 pounds by the WBC due to the introduction of bridgerweight. The fight had been rumored to take place in May 2022. This ultimately did not materialize, as Makabu was forced into a mandatory defense of his title in a rematch against Thabiso Mchunu on 29 January 2022, which the former won via split decision. Instead, it was announced on 25 February 2022 that \u00c1lvarez had signed a two-fight deal with Matchroom Boxing; the first fight would see him returning to the light heavyweight division to challenge undefeated WBA (Super) champion Dmitry Bivol on 7 May in a bout that would be televised as sports streaming service DAZN's first pay-per-view offering in the United States and Canada. In a surprise upset, all three judges scored the bout 115\u2013113 in Bivol's favor to hand \u00c1lvarez the second defeat of his professional career.

Many media reporters and pundits drew attention to the judges' official scorecards: all three judges had scored \u00c1lvarez the winner of the first four rounds, something that was roundly criticized, and described by ESPN reporter Mike Coppinger as \"puzzling\". Despite the widespread public opinion that Bivol was the deserved winner, \u00c1lvarez disagreed with this notion, stating in his post-fight interview: \"I don't feel like I lost the fight...

{"tuple1": {"tuple": ["<s>Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) Ronaldo Lu\u00eds Naz\u00e1rio de Lima (; born 18 September 1976), commonly known as Ronaldo or Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio, is a Brazilian business owner and president of La Liga club Real Valladolid, owner of Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A club Cruzeiro, and a former professional footballer who played as a striker. Nicknamed ('The Phenomenon') and R9, he is widely considered one of the greatest players of all time. As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position, Ronaldo has been an influence for a generation of strikers that have followed. His individual accolades include being named FIFA World Player of the Year three times and winning two Ballon d'Or awards. Ronaldo started his career at Cruzeiro and moved to PSV in 1994. He joined Barcelona in 1996 for a then world record transfer fee and at 20 years old, he was named the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year, making him the youngest recipient of the award. In 1997, Inter Milan broke the world record fee to sign Ronaldo, making him the first player since Diego Maradona to break the world transfer record twice. At 21, he received the 1997 Ballon d'Or and remains the youngest####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### recipient of the award. By the age of 23, Ronaldo had scored over 200 goals for club and country. However, after a series of knee injuries and recuperation, he was inactive for almost three years. Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2002 and won the 2002\u201303 La Liga title. He had spells at AC Milan and Corinthians before retiring in 2011, having suffered further injuries. Ronaldo played for Brazil in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals and is the third-highest goalscorer for his national team. At age 17, he was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo received the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament after he helped Brazil reach the final, where he suffered a convulsive fit hours before kick-off. He won the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in a front three with Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. He scored twice in the final and received the Golden Boot as the tournament's top goalscorer. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored his 15th World Cup goal, a tournament record at the time. He also won the 1997 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he became the player of the tournament and the 1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the top goalscorer. Ronaldo was one of the most marketable sportsmen in the world during his playing career. He was named in the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004 by Pel\u00e9 and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame, Italian Football Hall of Fame, Inter Milan Hall of Fame and Real Madrid Hall of Fame. In 2020, Ronaldo was named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI published by \"France Football\" magazine. Ronaldo has continued his work as a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador, a position to which he was appointed in 2000. Ronaldo became the majority owner of Real Valladolid in September 2018, after buying 51% of the club's shares. In December 2021, he bought a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro, investing $70 million in the club.</s><s>Early life. Ronaldo Lu\u00eds Naz\u00e1rio de Lima was born on 18 September 1976 in Rio de Janeiro as the third child of N\u00e9lio Naz\u00e1rio de Lima Snr. and S\u00f4nia dos Santos Barata. Ronaldo has a brother, N\u00e9lio Jr. His parents separated when he was 11, and Ronaldo dropped out of school shortly afterward to pursue a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### career in football. He played on the streets of Bento Ribeiro, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro. His mother states, \"I always found him on the street playing ball with friends when he should have been in school. I know, I lost my battle.\" He joined the Social Ramos futsal team at the age of 12 and led the city's youth league in scoring with a record 166 goals in his first season which included scoring 11 of his team's 12 goals in a single game. Crediting futsal for developing his skills, Ronaldo has said, \"futsal will always be my first love.\" His coach from Social Ramos, Alirio Carvalho, says: \"What was special about Ronaldo was his attitude. It was as if he had come from the moon. Nothing disturbed him, nothing overawed him, nothing threw him off his game.\" Spotted by former Brazilian player Jairzinho, who was coaching S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o, Ronaldo played for the S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o youth team. Under the guidance of coach Alfredo Sampaio, he progressed quickly through the ranks, playing for the clubs' under-17 and under-20 teams while only 15. Ronaldo's agents in Brazil, Re####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####inaldo Pitta and Alexandre Martins, signed him as a 13-year-old. Pitta stated, \"We saw right away that he could be something different than most other players.\" Recognized as a child prodigy, Jairzinho recommended the then 16-year-old to his former club Cruzeiro.</s><s>Club career.</s><s>Club career.:Cruzeiro. Ronaldo quickly attracted attention from big clubs, and his agents rejected offers from Botafogo and S\u00e3o Paulo. He was turned down by Flamengo, the team he supported as a boy, after missing practice due to an inability to afford the fare for the hour-long bus ride. Jairzinho saw Ronaldo's potential and helped get him a move to Cruzeiro. Ronaldo's agents accepted an offer of \u20ac50,000 from the club, and he scored four goals on his youth team debut. Three months after arriving at Cruzeiro, Ronaldo made his professional debut on 25 May 1993 against Caldense in the Minas Gerais State Championship. He came to national public attention on 7 November 1993, scoring five goals in the game against Bahia. His first senior goal came in a friendly during a tour of Portugal, scoring a goal against Bel####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####enenses and generally impressing new coach Carlos Alberto Silva, enough to become a first team regular. During the tour, his performance against Porto impressed enough that they bid $500,000, which was turned down by club president C\u00e9sar Masci. Upon returning from the tour, he scored 20 goals, with eight coming in the Supercopa Libertadores, including a hat-trick against Chilean side Colo-Colo in the first leg, and two in the second leg, before scoring a further three against Uruguayan team Nacional, resulting in him being the tournament's top goalscorer. Ronaldo scored 44 goals in 47 games with Cruzeiro, leading them to their first Copa do Brasil in 1993, and the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1994.</s><s>Club career.:PSV Eindhoven. Ronaldo joined PSV after the 1994 World Cup. He was selected for the tournament despite being just 17, but did not play in any games. His Brazil teammate Rom\u00e1rio having played for PSV from 1988 to 1993 advised Ronaldo to move to the club. On 28 August 1994, Ronaldo scored ten minutes into his debut against Vitesse, and scored a brace on his home debut against Go Ahead####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Eagles. He scored 30 league goals in his first season in the Netherlands, which included seven braces and a hat-trick against Utrecht. After scoring a hat-trick in PSV's game against Bayer Leverkusen in the 1994\u201395 UEFA Cup, Leverkusen striker and Germany World Cup winner Rudi V\u00f6ller stated in a post match press conference, \"Never in my life have I seen an 18-year-old play in this way.\" His dribbles from midfield caught the attention of many in the sport, with future Barcelona teammate Luis Enrique stating, \"I'd seen him on television at PSV and thought \u2018wow'. Then he came to Barcelona. He's the most spectacular player I've ever seen. He did things I'd never seen before. We're now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players, but not then. Ronaldo was a beast.\" Nick Miller, match reporter for \"The Guardian\", writes, \"What's striking about Ronaldo in that first year at PSV is how complete he looks, even as a skinny teenager. Everything that would come to define him \u2013 the lightning pace, the blurry stepovers, the implausible impression that he was faster with the ball than without it, even the exceptional upper-####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####body strength \u2013 was all there.\" Rob Smyth added, \"In many ways Ronaldo was the first PlayStation footballer. His stepover was a form of hypnosis, and his signature trick, the elastico, could certainly have come from a computer screen.\" Ronaldo's second season was marred by a knee injury which kept him out of most of the campaign, but he still averaged nearly a goal a game, scoring 19 goals in 21 appearances, including a UEFA Cup four-goal haul against Finnish side MyPa. With PSV, Ronaldo won the Dutch Cup in 1996 and he was Eredivisie top scorer in 1995. In his two seasons at the club he scored 54 goals in 58 games.</s><s>Club career.:Barcelona. During his spell at PSV, Ronaldo attracted the attention of both Inter Milan and FC Barcelona. It was Barcelona that was willing to pay the then world record fee of $19.5\u00a0million, and he joined the club on 17 July 1996. According to manager Bobby Robson, he signed an eight-year contract, and would play up front alone. Speaking to \"The New York Times\" regarding Ronaldo later that season, Robson said \"I don't think I've ever seen a player at 20 have so much\".####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### During the 1996\u201397 season, Ronaldo scored 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions, with his goal celebration invariably the same with his arms outstretched like the statue of \"Christ the Redeemer\" that watches over his native Rio de Janeiro. He led the Catalan side to UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph where he capped the season with the winning goal in the cup final, and to Copa del Rey and Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a wins. He also won La Liga top scorer award in 1997 with 34 goals in 37 games, and the European Golden Shoe. Until the 2008\u201309 season, Ronaldo remained the last player to score more than 30 goals in La Liga. Ronaldo was at his physical peak at Barcelona, and many of his 47 goals involved him rounding the goalkeeper before slotting the ball into the net. \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda, Ronaldo's teammate that season, stated, \"Back then, he was all fibre and muscle. He was a perfect physical specimen. Such incredible power matched to his technical skills could make him unstoppable.\" Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who worked as an interpreter at Barcelona, referred to Ronaldo as \"the greatest player I have ever seen in my life\", adding, \"I have no doubts. Ronaldo is the best my eyes have seen\",####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### and in 2014 regarded him as the best player post-Diego Maradona. Arguably Ronaldo's most memorable Barcelona goal was scored at SD Compostela on 11 October 1996; having received the ball inside his own half, he evaded a cynical tackle of the first opponent with a drag back, before running away from another and ran towards goal, going past two more defenders in the box with close ball control, before finishing into the bottom corner of the net. The camera then cut to manager Robson who had got up off the bench and clasped his head in disbelief at what he had seen. The footage of the goal was later used in a Nike advert with a voiceover asking: \"Imagine you asked God to be the best player in the world, and he listened to you\", and the goal was said to have been replayed 160 times on the main Spanish television channels in the 48 hours following the game. Half-way through the season, Barcelona agreed in principle to extend his contract to 2006, doubling his salary in the process. A hat-trick against Valencia, the third goal of which saw him dissect two Valencia defenders before striking the ball into the net, saw Barcelona fans waving white handkerchiefs as an expression of admiration for an exceptional####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### performance. Sid Lowe of \"Sports Illustrated\" states, \"That season Ronaldo was unstoppable. He was slim and powerful, skillful, fast and deadly. He was ridiculously good.\" At the end of 1996, aged 20, Ronaldo became the youngest player to win FIFA World Player of the Year.</s><s>Club career.:Inter Milan.</s><s>Club career.:Inter Milan.:1997\u20131999: World record transfer and Ballon d'Or win. Ronaldo's time at Barcelona lasted one season, as there were problems with the renegotiation of his contract. Barcelona thought there was an agreement in place, with Barcelona president Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez saying \"He's ours for life\", but when the parties reconvened the following day, the agreement collapsed, with N\u00fa\u00f1ez admitting: \"It's all over, Ronaldo is going\". Speaking to ESPN, Ronaldo stated, \"I had reached an agreement to renew my contract just a month before that season finished, but a week later the lawyer and the president of Barcelona agreed that that contract was absurd.\" Paying the buy out clause fee in his contract, Inter Milan signed him in the summer of 1997 for a then world record fee of $27\u00a0million, making him the second player, after Diego Mar####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####adona, to break the world transfer record twice. He signed a five-year contract with the Italians, and was unveiled to 4000 Inter fans at their training ground. His debut came on 27 July during the pre-season fixture against Manchester United. His competitive debut came on the opening day of the 1997\u201398 season against Brescia. Ronaldo adapted to the Italian style of the game in his first season, finishing with 25 Serie A goals, and was named Serie A Footballer of the Year. Ronaldo started to develop into a complete forward. He began racking up assists, became first-choice penalty taker, taking and scoring freekicks. Halfway through his first season he won FIFA World Player of the Year for the second time, and collected the Ballon d'Or. During his time with Inter, he scored several goals against city rivals AC Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. Ronaldo and prolific Fiorentina striker Gabriel Batistuta were the two best strikers in Serie A, with their duels the most anticipated in Italy. Ronaldo's goal celebrations often saw his Inter teammates congratulating him by kneeling down and pretending to shine his shoe. Ronaldo scored a trademark goal against Lazio in the 1998 UEFA Cup Final. Running through defence####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to go one on one with Lazio goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani, Ronaldo feinted to go right then left, without touching the ball, leaving Marchegiani on his backside, before going right and slotting the ball into the net. His Inter teammate Youri Djorkaeff stated; \"Ronaldo was phenomenal. He proved that he was a cut above the rest that season.\" After the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where he was named player of the tournament, Ronaldo was widely regarded as the best striker in the world. By the end of the 1998\u201399 season, he was appointed Inter Milan captain.</s><s>Club career.:Inter Milan.:1999\u20132002: Recurring injury problems. After two seasons with Inter, A. C. Milan defender Paolo Maldini viewed Ronaldo and Diego Maradona as the two best players he ever faced, stating, \"Ronaldo during his first two years at Inter was a phenomenon.\" Inter had high hopes going into the 1999\u20132000 season with their attack including Ronaldo and Italian stars Roberto Baggio and Christian Vieri. However, on 21 November, during a Serie A match against Lecce, Ronaldo felt his knee buckle and was forced to limp off the field. A medical examination confirmed that the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### striker had ruptured a tendon in his knee and would require surgery. During his first comeback on 12 April 2000, he played only six minutes during the first leg of the Coppa Italia final against Lazio before suffering a complete rupture of the knee-cap tendons. Ronaldo's physiotherapist Nilton Petrone stated, \"his knee-cap actually exploded\", and called it \"the worst football injury\" he's ever seen. Ronaldo was forced to miss the entire 2000\u201301 season and much of the two seasons either side of it. Since his Inter teammate Javier Zanetti had replaced him as the team captain during his absence, he eventually inherited the captain's armband in late 2001. After two operations and rehabilitation, Ronaldo came back for the 2002 World Cup, helping Brazil win their fifth World Cup title. Later in 2002, he won the FIFA World Player of the Year award for the third time, and transferred from Inter to Real Madrid. Ronaldo was given his most recognizable nickname,, by the Italian press while playing there. His Inter teammate Djorkaeff stated, \"when we were training, we would practically stop to watch him. It was extraordinary.\" Prior to his November 1999 injury Ronaldo had registered 42 goals in 58 Serie A games, in what was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the hardest league to score in with the most advanced defensive strategies and the world's best defenders. After five years he had played 99 games and scored 59 goals for \"Nerazzurri\". Ronaldo's performances at the club \u2013 especially the first two seasons before injury \u2013 saw him named among the four inaugural inductees into the Inter Milan Hall of Fame in 2018.</s><s>Club career.:Real Madrid.</s><s>Club career.:Real Madrid.:2002\u20132005: Ballon d'Or win and La Liga championship. Having signed for Real Madrid for \u20ac46\u00a0million, his jersey sales broke all records on the first day. Ronaldo was part of the \"Gal\u00e1cticos\" era of global stars signed by the club every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Lu\u00eds Figo, Roberto Carlos and David Beckham. He was sidelined through injury until October 2002 which added to the fans anticipation. Ronaldo scored twice on his debut against Alav\u00e9s, the first 61 seconds after coming on. That same reception was observed at the final game of the season against Athletic Bilbao, where Ronaldo scored to finish his first season with 23 league goals and seal La Liga title for 2003. He also won an Intercontinental Cup in 2002 and Spanish Super Cup in 2003,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### scoring in both finals. In the second leg of Real Madrid's Champions League quarter-final, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick against Manchester United at Old Trafford, knocking the English team out of the competition. Completing his hat-trick with a swerving strike from 30 yards, Ronaldo was substituted off after 67 minutes, and was given a standing ovation from both sets of fans. Reflecting on the ovation given to him from the oppositions' fans, Ronaldo stated that \"it remains a very beautiful, very special moment\". Manchester United defender Wes Brown commented, \"He was just unstoppable. A young Ronaldo [before a series of injuries] would have been even more dangerous, but it shows how good a player he was. Whenever he wanted to turn it on he could, on any stage, in any stadium\". Ronaldo scored in a 2\u20131 home win over Juventus in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals, but injury crucially kept him out of most of the second leg defeat where Real were eliminated. In the 2003\u201304 season, Madrid were on track to win the treble, until Ronaldo was injured towards the end of the season; they subsequently lost the Copa del Rey final, were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League quarter####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-finals to AS Monaco, and suffered a league form breakdown. During that second season at the club, Ronaldo scored one of the fastest goals in the club's history when he netted after 15 seconds in a league match against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u on 3 December 2003. Three days later he helped to ensure Real's first league victory over Barcelona at the Nou Camp in 20 years when he scored the second goal in a 2\u20131 victory over his former club. He finished the season as La Liga's top scorer with 25 goals and received the Pichichi Trophy for a second time, despite Madrid losing the league title to Valencia.</s><s>Club career.:Real Madrid.:2005\u20132007: Final two seasons. In his final two seasons at Real Madrid, Ronaldo missed a number of games with injuries and weight issues, and with the acquisition of Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2006, he grew further out of favour with the manager Fabio Capello. Speaking in 2017 on Ronaldo's weight issues and lack of fitness at Madrid, in addition to his ability, Capello summed up the conflicting emotions he has with the Brazilian, \"the most difficult player to handle was the best I coached: Ronaldo, il Fenomeno.\" In four and a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### half seasons at the club, Ronaldo scored over a century of goals, becoming the fifth foreigner at Madrid to achieve the feat after Argentine Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Hungarian Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Mexican Hugo S\u00e1nchez and Chilean Iv\u00e1n Zamorano. Although the knee injuries before 2002 meant he \"was robbed of the explosiveness of his early years\" (\"FourFourTwo\" magazine) by the time he signed for Real Madrid, Ronaldo was named by \"Marca\" as a member of the \"Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid's history\". While past his 1990s prime, Ronaldo still drew praise from his Madrid colleagues, with Zidane stating, \"Without hesitation, Ronaldo is the best player I ever played with or against. He had such an ease with the ball. Every day I trained with him, I saw something different, something new, something beautiful.\" Michael Owen, who joined Madrid in 2004, acknowledged that he never got the chance to play with Ronaldo in his prime when \"he had absolute blistering speed and strength, mesmerizing foot speed, he was just a blur, he'd be that fast\", before adding, \"even in training, he showed more than enough to convince me that I would have loved to play with him####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### at his peak.\" Teammates for six months, Van Nistelrooy said, \"Ronaldo was the best natural talent I ever played with. His innate ability went beyond anything that I'd ever seen or played alongside.\"</s><s>Club career.:AC Milan. On 18 January 2007, it was reported that Ronaldo agreed terms with AC Milan for a transfer of \u20ac8.05\u00a0million. Departing Real Madrid having been the club's leading goalscorer for all of his four full seasons, Ronaldo thanked everyone except Capello, \"I would like to thank the fans who've supported me all the time and thank all the teammates that I've had here and all the coaches I've had \u2013 except one\". Capello, who dropped him due to weight issues, commented, \"I wish him the best of luck in doing what he used to do which is being a great player.\" On 25 January, Ronaldo flew from Madrid to Milan, with statements on the club's website stating Ronaldo was in Milan for a medical, and that a meeting had been arranged with Real Madrid officials to discuss and finalize his transfer to the Milanese club. On 26 January, Ronaldo successfully completed his medical tests at the Milanello training complex under the supervision of club doctors, and the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### transfer was completed on 30 January. Wearing the number 99 jersey, he made his debut as a substitute on 11 February 2007 in the 2\u20131 victory over Livorno. The next game at Siena, on 17 February, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted on a third goal in his first start for Milan, as they won 4\u20133. In his first season, Ronaldo scored seven goals in 14 appearances. After his move to Milan, Ronaldo joined the list of the few players to have played for both Inter Milan and AC Milan in the Derby della Madonnina, and is one of few players to have scored for both rival teams in the Milan derby game (for Inter in the 1998\u201399 season and for AC Milan in the 2006\u201307 season), the others being players such as Giuseppe Meazza, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, Enrico Candiani and Aldo Cevenini. Ronaldo is also one of the few players to have started for Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, which also boasts a heated rivalry. Ronaldo, however, has never transferred directly between rival clubs. Ronaldo only played 300-plus minutes in his second season at Milan due to recurring injury problems and weight issues. Ronaldo's only goals in the 2007\u201308 season####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, besides his goal against Lecce in pre-season, came in a 5\u20132 victory against Napoli at the San Siro, where he scored an emotional double. It was also the first time Milan's much hyped attacking trio of Kak\u00e1, Alexandre Pato and Ronaldo, known as \"Ka-Pa-Ro\", played together. Despite tremendous success over the past decade, Ronaldo never won the UEFA Champions League in his club career. In 2019, \"FourFourTwo\" magazine named him the best player never to win the competition; in 2020, Sky Sports ranked him the second\u2013best player (after Diego Maradona) never to win the Champions League or European Cup. Ronaldo stated, \"I live football with a passion that doesn't give me any peace for not winning the Champions League \u2013 it's a trophy everyone would love to win.\" In 2011, Paul Wilson wrote in \"The Guardian\", \"Ronaldo was unlucky in his timing or his choice of club \u2013 for there is no doubt that at his very best he would have walked into any club in the world.\" During the 2006\u201307 season, though Milan won the 2006\u201307 title, Ronaldo was cup-tied with Madrid and ineligible to take part. The closest that he came####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to Champions League success was in 2003 when he helped Real Madrid to the semi-finals, in which they lost to Juventus. On 13 February 2008, Ronaldo suffered a severe season-ending knee injury while jumping for a cross in Milan 1\u20131 draw with Livorno, and was stretchered off and taken to a hospital. The club confirmed after the match that Ronaldo had ruptured the kneecap ligament in his left knee. It marked the third such occurrence of this injury, which he suffered twice to his right knee in 1999 and 2000. Teammate Clarence Seedorf stated, \"My heart stopped beating because it was like watching a repeat of the injury he suffered playing for Inter Milan against Lazio [in 2000]. His reaction was the same.\" Silvio Berlusconi told Italy's RAI TV, \"He fears for his career. I called him last evening and told him to believe in himself. He has enormous physical potential.\" Ronaldo was released by Milan at the end of the season, as his contract expired and was not renewed.</s><s>Club career.:Corinthians.</s><s>Club career.:Corinthians.:2009\u20132010: Paulist\u00e3o and Copa do Brasil. Ronaldo trained with Rio de Janeiro based Brazilian club Flamengo####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### during his recovery from knee surgery, and the club's board of directors said that the doors were open for him to join. On 9 December, however, Ronaldo signed a one-year deal with Flamengo's league rival Corinthians. The announcement received much publicity in the Brazilian press about his choice of Corinthians over Flamengo, since Ronaldo publicly declared himself a Flamengo fan. Rio-based sports newspaper \"Lance!\" called Ronaldo a \"phenomenal traitor\", and some angry fans burned Ronaldo shirts outside the Flamengo headquarters. Ronaldo responded that playing for Corinthians was the only option open to him. \"I understand perfectly, I'm openly a Flamengo fan. But I was training with Flamengo for four months and didn't receive any offer. Corinthians made an offer that will let me continue my career.\" Ronaldo played his first match for Corinthians on 4 March 2009, a Copa do Brasil match against Itumbiara at Est\u00e1dio Juscelino Kubitschek, in which he came as a substitute for Jorge Henrique. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Corinthians on 8 March 2009 in a Campeonato Paulista match against Palmeiras. Scoring eight goals in nine matches, his form led to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### calls for his return to the Brazil national team \u2013 nearly 70% of respondents in a poll for the \"O Globo\" newspaper voted that he should be reinstated, with the country's president Lula also calling for his immediate return. He scored twice in a 3\u20131 win against local rivals Santos in the first leg of the state championship final, with Santos idol Pel\u00e9 looking on from the stands. His second goal, a chip over the Santos goalkeeper from 30 yards out, sent the Corinthians fans into hysteria. Ultimately, he helped Corinthians win the Campeonato Paulista with 10 goals in 14 games. Ronaldo scored in Corinthians 4\u20132 aggregate defeat of Internacional in the final of the 2009 Copa do Brasil, helping the club win the trophy for the third time (the second of his career), thus earning a spot in the Copa Libertadores 2010. Following an injury lay off he returned on 20 September in a match against Goi\u00e1s, and a week later scored for Corinthians in a draw against S\u00e3o Paulo FC. He finished the Brazilian Serie A 2009 with 12 goals in 20 matches.</s><s>Club career.:Corinthians.:2011: Retirement. In February 2010, Ronaldo signed a contract extension with Corinthians that would keep him with####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the club until the end of 2011, and said he would then retire. Commenting on his weight issues following this announcement, Brian Homewood of \"The Guardian\" states, \"Sadly, Ronaldo's celebrity is now more of a draw than his skills on the pitch \u2013 Coldplay, Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres and actor Hugh Jackman have all visited S\u00e3o Paulo to get a picture with the roly\u2011poly star.\" In February 2011, after Corinthians were eliminated from the 2011 Copa Libertadores by the Colombian team Deportes Tolima, Ronaldo announced his retirement from football, concluding an 18-year career. In an emotional press conference on 14 February, he cited pain and hypothyroidism as the reasons for his premature retirement. He discovered he had hypothyroidism \u2013 a condition which slows down metabolism and causes weight gain \u2013 during tests with Milan in 2007. Ronaldo admitted his body had finally succumbed to the crippling litany of injuries that had blighted his career: \"It's very hard to leave something that made me so happy. Mentally I wanted to continue but I have to acknowledge that I lost to my body. The head wants to go on but the body can't take any more. I think of an action but I####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### can't do it the way I want to. It's time to go.\"</s><s>International career. Ronaldo made his international debut for Brazil on 23 March 1994 in a friendly match in Recife against Argentina. His first senior goal for Brazil came on 4 May 1994 in a 3\u20130 friendly win against Iceland. He went to the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States aged 17, but did not play as Brazil went on to win the tournament. He stated he was \"overjoyed\" at the experience. He was then known as \"Ronaldinho\" (\"little Ronaldo\" in Portuguese), because Ronaldo Rodrigues de Jesus, his older teammate, was also called Ronaldo and later nicknamed \"Ronald\u00e3o\" (\"big Ronaldo\") to further distinguish them. Another player, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, now widely known as Ronaldinho, was called \"Ronaldinho Ga\u00facho\" when he joined the Brazil team in 1999.</s><s>International career.:Summer Olympics and Copa Am\u00e9rica. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Ronaldo used the name \"Ronaldinho\" again, since centre-back Ronaldo Guiaro, two years his senior, was one of his teammates. Brazil went on to win the bronze medal. Ronaldo also represented Brazil in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the 1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica (finishing second) and won both the 1997 and the 1999 editions of the tournament. He was named player of the tournament in 1997, was the top scorer in 1999 and scored in the finals of both, against Bolivia in 1997 and Uruguay in 1999. He also took part in the friendly Tournoi de France in 1997, preceding the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring a goal as Brazil became runners-up. Ronaldo starred alongside Rom\u00e1rio, dubbed the \"Ro-Ro\" attack, at the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, helping Brazil win their first ever Confederations Cup title where he finished as the third-highest scorer with 4 goals, scoring a hat-trick against Australia in the final. On the combination of Ronaldo and Rom\u00e1rio, Will Sharp writes: \"...to the elation of all those fortunate enough to have watched them, they found themselves together, fated with the opportunity to forge one of the most outrageous offensive pairings the game has ever seen. Their partnership was brief but it was inexplicably brilliant.\"</s><s>International career.:1998 FIFA World Cup. Ronaldo entered the 1998 FIFA World Cup billed as the world's greatest player by reporters in the sport. Jacob Steinberg of \"The Guardian\" writes, \"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####In 1998, no one was as ferociously talented as Ronaldo, whose supernatural mixture of power, pace and skill had made him the player every child in the playground wanted to be; at the age of 21, the hopes and dreams of a nation rested on his shoulders.\" Ronaldo scored four goals and made three assists en route to the final, scoring once and assisting Bebeto's goal in a 3\u20130 win against Morocco in the team's second group stage match, netting twice in a 4\u20131 win against Chile in the round of 16, set\u2013up two goals in Brazil's 3\u20132 victory over Denmark in the quarter-finals, and scored once in the 1\u20131 draw against the Netherlands in the semi-finals, also netting Brazil's first penalty in the 4\u20132 shoot\u2013out victory. Hours before the final against France, Ronaldo suffered a convulsive fit. At first, he was removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, and the team sheet (with Edmundo as his replacement) was submitted to the FIFA delegate. The starting line up without Ronaldo was released to a stunned world media. The BBC's John Motson stated, \"The scenes in the commentary box have been absolute mayhem and chaos.\" However, shortly before####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### kick off, after pleading that he felt fine and requested to play, Ronaldo was reinstated by Brazil coach M\u00e1rio Zagallo. Ronaldo was the last Brazilian player out of the tunnel as the teams entered the field. During the playing of the Brazil national anthem the camera focused on him throughout, with Ronaldo showing little emotion. Steinberg states that Ronaldo \"sleepwalked\" through the final, which also saw him injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Zagallo admitted the fears over Ronaldo affected his team psychologically, and stated \"for the whole of the first half I was wondering whether to take him off\", but feared a public outcry in Brazil had he done so. Brazil lost the match to hosts France 3\u20130. Ronaldo later reflected: \"We lost the World Cup but I won another cup \u2013 my life.\" An inquest was launched in Brazil, with team doctor L\u00eddio Toledo telling the commission \"imagine if I stopped Ronaldo playing and Brazil lost. At that moment I'd have to go and live on the North Pole.\" Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham University, said that Ronaldo should not have played, that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure, and \"there is no way that he####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### would have been able to perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his first fit \u2013 if it was his first fit.\" Despite his sub-par performance in the final due to his seizure hours earlier, Ronaldo was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament for his performances leading up to the final, and finished the tournament as the joint-third highest scorer. The nature of the incident set off a trail of questions and allegations which persisted for years, with Alex Bellos writing in \"The Guardian\", A conspiracy surrounded Nike, the sportswear company who sponsored Ronaldo and the Brazilian national team, with some in Brazil believing the company had forced Ronaldo to play. The parliamentary inquiry was unable to find any wider conspiracy, although the Brazilian public remained unconvinced. Reporting for CNN, Don Riddell wrote, \"It's one of the great mysteries of our time: not the Loch Ness Monster, Stonehenge or the Lost City of Atlantis; it's the case of the missing striker \u2013 not so much a whodunit, more a kind of a what the heck happened?\"</s><s>International career.:2002 FIFA World Cup. Prior to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo had barely played since rupturing the cruciate ligament in his right####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### knee in April 2000, and he missed Brazil's entire qualification campaign where, in his absence, the team had been poor. Tim Vickery writes, \"Without Ronaldo, Brazil were a shambles, fortunate even to get to the tournament. With him, it was a different story.\" In a remarkable comeback from injury that had threatened his career, Ronaldo led Brazil to their record fifth World Cup title, receiving the Golden Boot as top scorer with eight goals. Many publications regarded his personal triumph as \"redemption\" for what occurred at the previous World Cup. Ronaldo spoke about his obsession with lifting the World Cup trophy, having missed out in 1998. \"I used to visualise the trophy in front of my eyes and imagine what a wonderful feeling it must be to hold it up in the air. It was a fabulous feeling actually to hold it in my hands and kiss it.\" Dubbed the \"three R's\", Ronaldo starred in a formidable attack alongside Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, and the trio were named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. Ronaldo scored against every opponent in the tournament except in the quarter-finals against England. The match-winner against Turkey in the semi-final, with the winning goal a toe-poke finish with little back-lift while####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### on the run \u2013 a finish he learned while playing futsal in his youth \u2013 the final whistle saw fans behind the goal hoist huge white letters to spell out his name akin to the Hollywood sign. Much attention was on his haircut \u2013 only part of his head was shaved \u2013 done as a deliberate distraction to shift media attention away from a leg injury. He revealed, \"when I arrived in training with this haircut everybody stopped talking about the injury\". In the final against Germany in Yokohama, Japan, Ronaldo scored twice in Brazil's 2\u20130 win and tied Pel\u00e9's Brazilian record of 12 career World Cup goals. Ronaldo was the first player to seek out German players to offer his condolences, before he was congratulated by Pel\u00e9 when receiving his World Cup winners medal. G\u00e9rard Saillant, the French surgeon who operated on Ronaldo's knee, was in the crowd as his guest, and stated after the game; \"This gives hope to everyone who is injured, even those who aren't sportsmen, to see that by fighting you can make it. He's back to where he was; it's hugely satisfying and I am very moved.\" Ronaldo received a number of accolades for his achievement, including the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Year and the BBC World Sport Star of the Year, and in December 2002 he dedicated his third FIFA World Player of the Year award to the medical team which helped him recover. In a 2017 interview with Fox Sports, Ronaldo stated, \"the best team I played in was the Brazilian one in 2002, we felt that we could always score. It was a team without any vanity, or individuals. The collective was important.\"</s><s>International career.:2006 FIFA World Cup. On 2 June 2004, Ronaldo scored an unusual hat-trick of penalties for Brazil against arch-rivals Argentina in a 2006 World Cup qualifying match, which put them top of the group. With 10 goals in 15 games, including a goal against Venezuela in the last game to secure first place, Ronaldo was the South American top scorer in Brazil's qualifying campaign. Prior to the tournament, questions were asked of his weight and fitness, but was declared fit for Brazil's opening match with Croatia. At the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo was part of a much-publicized \"magic quartet\" alongside Adriano, Ronaldinho and Kak\u00e1. The all-star Brazilian team was promoted as masters of Joga Bonito, \"the beautiful game\", which was advertised by Nike before the tournament. Although Brazil won####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### their first two group games against Croatia and Australia, Ronaldo was repeatedly jeered for being overweight and slow, but coach Carlos Alberto Parreira kept him in the starting lineup. With two goals against Japan in the third match, Ronaldo became the 20th player to score in three World Cups and also equalled the all-time World Cup finals scoring record of fourteen, held by Gerd M\u00fcller (Ronaldo scored at France 98, Korea/Japan 2002 and Germany 2006). He then broke M\u00fcller's record in the Round of 16 match against Ghana by scoring his fifteenth-career World Cup goal. With his third goal of the tournament, Ronaldo became only the second player ever, after J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, to score at least three goals in each of three World Cups. Brazil, however, were knocked out by France 1\u20130 with a goal by striker Thierry Henry in the quarter-finals. Ronaldo was awarded the Bronze Shoe as the third-highest goal-scorer of the World Cup. Having been listed in \"Guinness World Records\", Ronaldo stated, \"I am proud of my career and of the records I set. But I know that one day they will be broken.\" Ronaldo and Klinsmann's shared record of at least####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### three goals in three separate World Cup finals was broken by German striker Miroslav Klose, who has a record of at least four goals in each of three tournaments, having netted five at both the 2002 and 2006 finals, and four at the 2010 tournament. Ronaldo finished with fifteen goals in nineteen World Cup matches, for an average of 0.79 per game. His teammate Kak\u00e1 reflected, \"Ronaldo is the best player I have ever played with. I have seen il Fenomeno do things nobody else has ever done.\"</s><s>International career.:Farewell match and sporadic appearances. In February 2011, it was announced that Ronaldo would be given one last match for Brazil, a friendly against Romania in S\u00e3o Paulo on 7 June 2011, five years after his last match with the national team. Brazilian Football Confederation official Ricardo Teixeira stated that it was fitting that his final game should take place in Brazil while representing his nation. Ronaldo played for 15 minutes in a match that ended with a Brazilian victory with a goal from Fred. Fred celebrated his goal with Ronaldo's famous 'finger wag' celebration along with his Brazilian teammates. Ronaldo was introduced after 30 minutes, partnering 19-year-old Neymar in attack, and had three shots on target which were####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### saved by the Romanian goalkeeper. After the first half ended, Ronaldo made a farewell speech to the crowd. With 62 goals for Brazil Ronaldo retired from international football as the second-highest goalscorer for his country, behind only Pel\u00e9 (Neymar has since moved into second place, with Ronaldo the third-highest scorer as of October 2020). On 13 December 2011 Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane played a charity match with their friends against former and current players of the German team Hamburg in the ninth edition of the Match Against Poverty series, which Ronaldo and Zidane established in 2003. In December 2012, Ronaldo and Zidane reunited for the Match Against Poverty in Porto Alegre, Portugal, with the field littered with World Cup winners from France and Brazil, which also saw 1982 World Cup star Zico (Ronaldo's childhood idol) turn out for Ronaldo's team. In January 2013, Ronaldo was named one of the six ambassadors of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Ronaldo was chosen as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2000 as he had the highest global appeal among sportspeople, and he accepted the role as he saw it as \"an obligation\" to help with causes around the world. Ronaldo played in####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the UNDP's 11th Match Against Poverty on 4 March 2014 against a Zidane XI in Bern, Switzerland, with proceeds raised helping the recovery efforts in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. Joined by Didier Drogba in attack, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in the next year's match on 21 April 2015 in St Etienne, France, with proceeds going towards the African countries most affected by the Ebola epidemic. On 14 June 2018, Ronaldo featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. He walked out with a child wearing a Russia 2018 shirt at the beginning, and returned at the end of the ceremony with the official ball of the 2018 World Cup \u2013 Adidas Telstar 18 \u2013 which was sent into space with the International Space Station crew in March and came back to Earth in early June.</s><s>Style of play and legacy. Ronaldo is regarded as one of the greatest and most complete forwards of all time. Nicknamed \"Il (or O) Fenomeno\" (the phenomenon), he was a prolific goalscorer, and despite being more of an individualistic attacker, he was also capable of providing assists for his teammates, due to his vision, passing and crossing ability####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. He was an extremely powerful, fast, and technical player, with excellent movement, as well as being a composed finisher. Highly regarded for his technical ability, Ronaldo was able to use both feet, despite being naturally right footed, and is considered one of the most skilful dribblers in the game. Ronaldo would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal, with Rob Smyth writing, \"he played like every attack had a 10-second deadline.. he would explode into life with no warning for defenders.\" He frequently beat several players when dribbling at speed, and excelled in one on one situations, due to his ball control, acceleration, agility, balance and nimble footwork in his prime. His coach at Barcelona, Bobby Robson, commented: \"Ronaldo could start from the halfway line and the whole stadium would ignite. He was the fastest thing I've ever seen running with the ball. Had he managed to stay free of injury, he had every chance of becoming the best footballer ever.\" In one on one situations, Ronaldo often used elaborate feints to trick and beat defenders and goalkeepers; he popularised the use of many football tricks such as the elastico and the step over. Sid Lowe of \"Sports####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Illustrated\" wrote, \"When he was one on one with the goalkeeper, you knew that he would score. He was so natural, so cool, so utterly in control. He would dip the shoulder, step over, and bang!\" His Barcelona teammate \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda observed, \"I'd never seen anyone play football with such technical ability, creativity and precision at that incredible speed. What stood out to all of us, from the moment we met Ronnie, was that he could do things which other players found very difficult and make them look easy. But he could also produce those things while running at an unbelievable, explosive pace.\" With his combination of speed, skill and finishing Ronaldinho called Ronaldo \"the most complete striker there has ever been\", a view echoed by Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, who stated, \"as a football player, he was complete. There will never, in my view, be a better player than him.\" The goalscoring idol of Lionel Messi, the Argentine states \"Ronaldo was the best striker I've ever seen. He was so fast he could score from nothing.\" Wanting to emulate Ronaldo growing up, Egypt and Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah opined, \"The ability, the speed, the intelligence, he had everything\". N####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####aming Ronaldo as an inspiration, Wayne Rooney stated, \"as an out-and-out forward he was probably the best.\" The outstanding influence for a generation of strikers, from Karim Benzema to Sergio Ag\u00fcero, with Romelu Lukaku stating \"he changed the dimension of a striker\" and could \"dribble like a winger, run like a sprinter\", Zlatan added, \"nobody influenced football and the players who emerged as much as Ronaldo\". Emilio Butrague\u00f1o stated, \"Ronaldo creates a goalscoring opportunity where it doesn't exist. Most strikers need the midfielders and their teammates, but he does not.\" On his speed of thought, Kak\u00e1 said \"For me the best players are those who are able to think of a play and execute it quickest and in the best way possible, and Ronaldo was the best at that. The speed of thought he had \u2013 and the speed he had to carry out his actions \u2013 were perfect.\" Ronaldo was also a strong and powerful player who could shield the ball from the opposition, with former Italian defender Alessandro Nesta (who faced Ronaldo in a high-profile one on one duel in the 1998 UEFA Cup final which was billed as \"the best attacker against the best defender####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in Serie A\") stating: \"It was the worst experience of my career. Ronaldo is the hardest attacker I've ever had to face.\" Asked who was the toughest opponent of his career, Fabio Cannavaro responded, \"I have no doubt, Ronaldo, the phenomenon. For my generation he was what Maradona or Pel\u00e9 were for the previous ones. He was unmarkable.\" Sid Lowe compared Ronaldo's ability to take on a number of opponents on a single run to what rugby player Jonah Lomu was doing in the same era. Comparing his natural ability to Roger Federer, Paul MacDonald of \"Goal\" wrote, \"there's a joy to be had watching something we know to be extremely difficult executed with considerable ease. Ronaldo in his prime was able to do that better than anyone who has ever played the game.\" A reliance on his superior innate ability is given as a reason for his application in training often not being as high as his teammates \u2013 though his knee issues may also have been a factor \u2013 with his Brazil teammate Emerson stating \"Ronaldo felt he didn't need to work as hard as us, that he could do in two days what the rest of us would take ten days to do. And usually, he was right\". On his####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### precocious talent \u2013 a talent which saw him become the youngest FIFA World Player of the Year at age 20, and youngest Ballon d'Or recipient aged 21 \u2013 Rob Smyth of \"The Guardian\" wrote in 2016, \"Ronaldo is easily the best of the past 30 years, possibly ever. The other Ronaldo and Messi were brilliant teenagers but had nothing like the same impact at that age. Only Pel\u00e9, Diego Maradona and George Best can really compare.\" Asked to name the best player of his lifetime, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho said, \"Ronaldo, El Fenomeno. Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi have had longer careers. They have remained at the top every day for 15 years. However, if we are talking strictly about talent and skill, nobody surpasses Ronaldo.\" Mika\u00ebl Silvestre states, \"I played against [Lionel] Messi and I played with Cristiano at Manchester United, but he [Ronaldo] is something else in terms of speed. Cristiano, maybe you can guess that he has three or four tricks he would use most of the time, but Ronaldo, it was always something different. He was inventing things on the spot, so you can't guide him left or right because he's going to get####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### out of these situations, no matter what\". In 2020, Ronaldo was named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI published by \"France Football\" magazine. At his physical peak in the 1990s, Ronaldo became severely affected by the knee injuries he suffered from late 1999 onward and the subsequent weight gain during his inactivity, which limited his speed, fitness, and mobility. According to his physiotherapist Nilton Petrone, Ronaldo was vulnerable to injury due to a medical condition combined with his explosive running. \"Ronaldo had a problem called trochlear dysplasia. This makes the relationship between the kneecap and the femur a bit unstable. There is no direct surgery for that so the kneecap keeps, for a lack of a better word, \"dancing\" on the femur. Ronaldo's injuries weren't because his body was weak, but because of his explosive capacity. He didn't just run fast in a straight line, he also changed direction at incredible speed. Ronaldo moved from left to right very fast...so it was obvious, by the way that he played, that injuries were always a possibility\". Acknowledging \"he was never quite the same\" after his knee injury in 2000, with \"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####his pace and sheer brute force diminished in comparison to The Phenomenon\" in the 1990s, \"FourFourTwo\" magazine ranked him the best player at the 2002 World Cup, adding \"he was still a cut above the rest\" in the tournament.</s><s>Club ownership.</s><s>Club ownership.:Real Valladolid. In September 2018, Ronaldo became the majority owner of La Liga club Real Valladolid after buying a 51% controlling stake in the club for \u20ac30 million. At his unveiling as the club's new owner at Valladolid city hall, Ronaldo stated, \"I have gone through many stages in my training in football to prepare for this. Football is all about passion. We want to build the best team possible to compete while also giving information about our management with transparency.\"</s><s>Club ownership.:Cruzeiro. In December 2021, Ronaldo bought a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro. Investing 400 million reais ($70 million) in the club, Ronaldo stated he wants to \"give back to Cruzeiro and take them where they deserve to be.\"</s><s>Outside football.</s><s>Outside football.:Personal life. During 1997, Ronaldo met the Brazilian model and actress Susana Werner on the set of Brazilian teleno####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####vela \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\" when they acted together in three episodes. Although they never married, they began a long-term relationship and lived together in Milan until the beginning of 1999. In December 1999, Ronaldo married Brazilian footballer Milene Domingues, at the time pregnant with the couple's first son, Ronald, who was born in Milan, on 6 April 2000. The marriage lasted four years. In 2005, Ronaldo became engaged to Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniela Cicarelli, who became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage; the relationship lasted only three months after their luxurious wedding at the Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly. The ceremony reportedly cost \u00a3700,000 (\u20ac896,000). Despite his fame \u2013 a 2003 poll by Nike listed him the world's most famous sportsperson (and third most famous person overall) \u2013 Ronaldo is protective of his privacy, including with teammates, stating in an interview with \"The Telegraph\", \"each [player] has his own private life, and no one thinks about anyone else's private life. Or talks about it.\" By 2003 he was fluent in Portuguese, Spanish and Italian, and had a good understanding of English. In a 2005 interview with \"Folha de S.Paulo\", Ronaldo revealed####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### that, somewhat unexpectedly, he identified racially as white, generating a wider conversation about the complex role of race in Brazil. Ronaldo's father, Nelio Nazario, stated, \"He knows full well that he's black. Actually, at the time, I thought it was some philosophy, something to that effect. Because he knows he's black.\" According to a study led by geneticist S\u00e9rgio Pena of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, most Brazilians often have a misconception about their roots. \"The maternal ancestry of the Brazilian white was one-third African, one third Amerindian, and one third European. An individual who considers himself white may be genomically more African than an individual who considers himself to be brown or black.\" In April 2008, Ronaldo was involved in a scandal involving three travesti prostitutes whom he met in a nightclub in Rio de Janeiro. Ronaldo claimed that upon discovering that they were legally male, he offered them $600 to leave. One of the three attempted to blackmail Ronaldo, while the other two admitted to lying about having sex with him. Ronaldo's engagement to Maria Beatriz Antony was immediately halted, but resumed shortly after. Maria Beatriz Antony gave birth to their first daughter, named Maria Sophia####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####, in Rio de Janeiro, on 24 December 2008. In April 2009, the family moved to a new penthouse in S\u00e3o Paulo. On 6 April 2010, Maria Beatriz Antony gave birth to their second daughter. The girl, born in S\u00e3o Paulo, was named Maria Alice, and was born exactly 10 years after her older brother Ronald. In December 2010, Ronaldo and his family moved to a new mansion in S\u00e3o Paulo. Also in December, Ronaldo took a paternity test and was confirmed to be the father of a boy named Alexander, born in April 2005. The boy was born after a brief relationship between Ronaldo and Michele Umezu, a Brazilian waitress who Ronaldo first met in Tokyo in 2002. After the confirmation of his fourth child, Ronaldo stated on 6 December 2010 that he had had a vasectomy, feeling that having four children was enough. In a 2011 interview with the BBC, former Real Madrid teammate Steve McManaman spoke about Ronaldo's personality. \"He could go in a restaurant, and I could go in with him, and you're not just there with close friends. He invites everybody. You'd be at a table with him and it'd be a judge sitting opposite talking to a politician with someone off the street listening in. So he####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### just had this amazing aura, where everyone wanted to join him. Sometimes there'd be 20 to 30 people sitting at meal times with him. He was a wonderful person. Everybody would second that, no matter what club he played for.\" Ronaldo was the co-owner of A1 Team Brazil, along with former F1 driver Emerson Fittipaldi. Ronaldo co-owns the sports marketing company 9INE, with his friend, mixed martial artist Anderson Silva, one of his clients.

To celebrate 15 years of the boot, Nike created a Mercurial Vapor IX inspired by the 1998 design, with####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Phil McCartney, VP of Football Footwear for Nike, stating; \"Ronaldo's impact on the game 15 years ago was immense, and in the run up to 2014, we wanted to celebrate that boot and the man himself. We thought a modern construction of his 1998 boot would be a great commemoration of that moment.\" In 2018, Ronaldo's R9 Mercurial boots inspired the Nike Mercurial Superfly VI boots commissioned for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Unveiled in 2000, a bronze statue of Ronaldo is located next to Ronaldo Field at Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. Ronaldo has appeared in a series of Nike commercials. He starred in the 1996 Nike commercial titled \"Good vs Evil\" in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre.

Her role was that of Shruti Kakkar, an ambitious middle-class Punjabi girl who starts her own wedding planning business. In preparation for the part, Sharma learned to speak in the Punjabi dialect, which she cited as the toughest part of her role; she described the way the lead characters in the film interact as \"crude####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### but cute\" and it required her to \"talk fast, sometimes mix words and even omit words completely\". Trade analysts expressed doubt on \"Band Baaja Baaraat\"s financial prospect, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star, and saying that by then Sharma was an \"almost-forgotten\" actress. However, \"Band Baaja Baaraat\" earned positive reviews and emerged as a sleeper hit. Sharma's performance was praised by critics, many of whom cited it as her best work to that point. The critic Anupama Chopra wrote that Sharma \"comes into her own as the ambitious Delhi girl, who dreams of upgrading to multi-crore Sainik Farms weddings\". For her work in the film, Sharma received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Sharma's first venture not to be produced by Yash Raj Films was the drama \"Patiala House\" (2011) directed by Nikkhil Advani and co-starring Akshay Kumar. The film tells the story of a budding cricketer (played by Kumar) who encounters trouble in convincing his father of his profession; Sharma was cast as the love interest of Kumar's character. Suk####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####anya Verma of Rediff.com praised Sharma's work and labelled her a \"metaphor for energy\". That same year, she re-united with co-star Ranveer Singh and director Maneesh Sharma for the comedy-drama \"Ladies vs Ricky Bahl\". She featured as Ishika Desai, a salesgirl hired to outwit a conman (essayed by Singh), who ends up falling in love with him instead. The film and Sharma's performance received mixed reviews, with Piyali Dasgupta of NDTV calling her \"believable but not endearing\". Despite mixed reviews, the film was a moderate success at the box office. In 2012, Sharma played a supporting role alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif in Yash Chopra's \"swan song\", the romance \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\", which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films and her second with Khan. She was cast as Akira Rai, a Discovery Channel reporter who harbours ambitions of being a documentary filmmaker. Rajeev Masand wrote that Sharma \"brings a spark to the film\", but Raja Sen disagreed and said that \"while Anushka can indeed play spunky, she needed here to tone it down####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### several notches\". For her role, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" proved to be the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2012. Sharma next appeared in Vishal Bhardwaj's \"Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola\" (2013), a political satire set in a village in Haryana. Co-starring alongside Pankaj Kapur, Imran Khan and Shabana Azmi, Sharma played the titular role of Bijlee Mandola, a strong-headed girl who engages in a romantic affair with Khan's character despite being engaged to another man. The film received positive to mixed reviews from critics, and underperformed at the box office. Several critics noted that Sharma was being stereotyped as a loud and loquacious girl; Raja Sen noted that she \"is great in a couple of scenes near the climax,\" though Kanika Sikka of \"Daily News and Analysis\" was more critical and found her \"unconvincing\".</s><s>Acting career.:Established actress and expansion into film production (2014\u20132016). In 2014, Sharma played a television journalist who befriends an alien (played by Aamir Khan), in Rajk####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####umar Hirani's religious satire \"PK\". Critic Saibal Chatterjee wrote that Sharma plays \"a feisty poetry-loving girl who knows her mind far more than most Hindi film heroines are allowed to\" and praised her for \"hold[ing] her own\" against Khan. Critically acclaimed, \"PK\" emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film with a worldwide revenue of over. Sharma launched a production company named Clean Slate Filmz, whose first release was Navdeep Singh's thriller \"NH10\" (2015), in which she also played the lead role. Screened at the 5th Beijing International Film Festival, it tells the story of a married couple whose lives are endangered after an encounter with a group of criminals. In preparation, Sharma underwent interval training for three months to build her stamina. Saibal Chatterjee found the film to be a \"taut and riveting thriller\" and praised Sharma for \"conveying a range of moods as she moves from the vulnerable to the fearless in a battle in which the odds are stacked heavily against her\", and Prarthana Sarkar of \"International Business Times\" credited her for breaking away from her romantic comedy image. The film also emerged as a box office success. In An####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####urag Kashyap's period crime drama \"Bombay Velvet\" (2015), (based on the historian Gyan Prakash's book \"Mumbai Fables\") co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Karan Johar, Sharma was cast as a jazz singer, Rosie Noronha. Her character was referenced from the actresses Brigitte Bardot, Helen and Waheeda Rehman. To prepare, Sharma watched films of the 1950s and 1960s, and documentaries about hair and make-up. She also used temporary lip enhancers for the part, citing it as the reason behind her changed appearance on a chat show in 2014, and refuted media speculation about having undergone plastic surgery. \"Bombay Velvet\" was screened at the Locarno and Bucheon film festivals; critical opinion was mixed. Writing for \"Business Standard\", Ritika Bhatia praised Sharma's performance in the song \"Dhadaam Dhadaam\": \"she fills the stage with such raw emotion that her mascara-laden tears and fake eyelashes flutter with arresting passion\". However, the film failed to recoup its investment. In the same year, Sharma featured in the supporting role of a dancer aboard a cruise ship in Zoya Akhtar's####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"Dil Dhadakne Do\", an ensemble comedy-drama in which she was featured opposite Ranveer Singh. The song sequence \"Pehli Baar\" was choreographed by her and Singh; Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters praised their on-screen chemistry and described it as \"crackling\". Her performances in \"NH10\" and \"Dil Dhadakne Do\" earned Sharma Filmfare Award nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Sharma next reunited with Yash Raj Films in \"Sultan\" (2016), a romantic sports drama from the writer-director Ali Abbas Zafar. She took on the role of Aarfa Hussain, a wrestler from Haryana who inspires the title character (played by Salman Khan) to take up the sport. Sharma was initially hesitant to play the part as she did not have the physique of a wrestler; she researched on different weight categories to \"beat people's perception that all wrestlers are huge.\" She trained for six weeks in the sport, learned to speak the Haryanvi dialect, and interacted with female wrestlers from the state. The film and her performance received mixed reviews. Critics were appreciative of her substantial role in an androcentric film;####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"Filmfare\"s Rachit Gupta described Sharma as \"the best thing in the film\" and noted that \"[e]ven though she doesn't have the physique of a wrestler, her spirited performance makes you believe in her tough but emotional character.\" However, Suprateek Chatterjee of \"The Huffington Post\" felt that she was unconvincing as a wrestler, writing that \"she possesses literally zero muscles and somehow always finds the time to get her make-up just right.\" With earnings of over worldwide, \"Sultan\" ranks among Indian cinema's biggest grossers. Sharma achieved further success later that year when she played the lead female role of Alizeh Khan, a free-spirited girl in a loveless relationship in Karan Johar's romantic drama \"Ae Dil Hai Mushkil\", alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai. Mike Maccahil of \"The Guardian\" took note of how much Sharma \"terrific spikiness\" and her chemistry with Kapoor helped a mediocre picture. In another typical mixed review, Sweta Kaushal of \"Hindustan Times\" praised Sharma's empowered female lead. The film earned over worldwide, and Sharma received a Best Actress nomination at the 62####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####nd Filmfare Awards. With two top-grossing films in 2016, Bollywood Hungama ranked Sharma as the most successful Bollywood actress of the year.</s><s>Acting career.:Career fluctuations, production focus, and hiatus (2017\u2013present). The 2017 fantasy comedy \"Phillauri\", co-starring Suraj Sharma and Diljit Dosanjh, featured Sharma as a friendly ghost who wants to reunite with her lover. In addition to acting and producing, Sharma also sang a song in it. She next collaborated with Shah Rukh Khan for the third time in Imtiaz Ali's \"Jab Harry Met Sejal\", a romance about a Gujrati tourist (Sharma) in Europe who falls in love with her tour guide. Commenting on Sharma's performances in \"Phillauri\" and \"Jab Harry Met Sejal\", Uday Bhatia of \"Mint\" praised her ability for \"straight-faced com[edy]\". Bhatia, however, criticised her pairing with Khan, 22 years her senior, in the latter film. Unlike her 2016 releases, both these films were box office flops. Sharma's first film release of 2018 was the horror film \"Pari\", which she starred in and####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### produced. It tells the story of Rukhsana (Sharma), a battered young woman living in the wilderness, who is rescued by a benevolent man (played by Parambrata Chatterjee). Though Shubhra Gupta of \"The Indian Express\" found the film \"scatter-brained\" and added that \"nothing can rescue it, not even a leading lady who is determined to do something different with her producing heft\", Sukanya Verma featured her performance in Rediff.com's annual list of best actresses, writing, \"going from unhinged to ghastly to mesmeric, here's an actress who's game for everything.\" It earned worldwide against a production budget of. Sharma next played a biographer documenting the life of the troubled actor Sanjay Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's biopic \"Sanju\", starring Ranbir Kapoor in the title role. Rajeev Masand commended the film's ensemble but was critical of Sharma's performance, writing that she \"sticks out with strange hair and stranger accent\". Even so, it emerged as her third release to earn over worldwide. In the same year, Sharma teamed with Yash Raj Films for the eighth time in \"Sui Dhaaga\", a comedy-####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####drama co-starring Varun Dhawan, about a poor, young couple who begin their own small-scale clothing industry. Ronak Kotecha of \"The Times of India\" praised the subtle chemistry between the leads and credited Sharma for playing the restrained role effortlessly. She received a nomination for the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress. Sharma's final film appearance of the year was in \"Zero\", a drama about a dwarf's romantic tribulations involving two women, which reunited her with Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif. She played a NASA scientist with cerebral palsy, for which she met with an occupational therapist and an audiologist; she also stayed in character and chose to use a wheelchair between shots. Anupama Chopra considered her portrayal of the condition to be \"inconsistent and clumsy\" but Namrata Joshi of \"The Hindu\" found her \"earnest and invested\". As with her previous collaboration with Khan, \"Zero\" was a commercial failure. In 2020, Sharma served as executive producer for her company's crime thriller series \"Paatal Lok\", which was released on Amazon Prime Video, and produced the horror film \"Bulbbul\" for Netflix. Anna M. M. Vetticad found recurring themes of####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### \"feminism and the paranormal\" in several of her company's projects, and credited Sharma for her \"courageous, non-conformist\" choices as a producer. In 2022, Sharma announced that she would step away from her producing duties for her banner Clean Slate Filmz, and that her brother would be the sole owner of the company. Sharma will return to acting after four years with a biopic of cricketer Jhulan Goswami, named \"Chakda 'Xpress\", which will release on Netflix.</s><s>Personal life and off-screen work. Sharma started practicing vegetarianism in 2015. \"The Times of India\" has listed her as one of \"Bollywood's hottest vegetarian celebrities\". She has also been named as \"The Person of the Year\" by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) on multiple occasions. She is an avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation. Sharma has confessed to being a victim of anxiety disorder and seeking treatment for it. A practicing Hindu, Sharma, along with her family, is a follower of Anant Dham Atmabodh Ashram in Haridwar. The ashram is headed by Maharaj Anant Baba, who is her family's spiritual####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### guru and the actress is a regular visitor to the ashram. Sharma's romantic relationship with the cricketer Virat Kohli has attracted substantial media coverage in India, though she has been reluctant to publicly talk about it. The couple married in Italy on 11 December 2017. On 11 January 2021, Sharma gave birth to a girl, Vamika. On June 14 2022, Anushka Shama publicly criticized the Times Group for sharing a photo of her daughter taken on vacation without her permission. Anushka is extremely private about her personal life and has repeatedly requested the media and paparazzi to not share pictures of her daughter. In September 2013, Sharma participated and walked the ramp in a fashion show that was held in memory of the late filmmaker, Yash Chopra. She participated in the opening ceremony of the 2015 Indian Premier League held at Kolkata, along with other celebrities including Hrithik Roshan, Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan, Farhan Akhtar and composer Pritam. Apart from acting, Sharma supports a number of charities and causes. She walked the ramp to support Shabana Azmi's Mijwan Welfare Society, a Non-governmental organization that helps empower women. In 2013, alongside other B####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####ollywood actors, she pledged to support the education of India's young girls as part of NDTV's \"Our Girls, Our Pride\" fundraiser. That same year, she appeared alongside other celebrities in a commercial, produced by the National Film Development Corporation of India, to create awareness about the 'Right to Education' for children. In December 2014, Sharma auctioned the leather jacket she wore in \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" on eBay, with proceeds going to the redevelopment of the flood-ravaged states of Kashmir and Assam. Sharma had also fronted a campaign to collect donations for the victims of the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. She supports the annual Mumbai Film Festival, and donated money in its cause in 2015. Sharma has been vocal about the disparity in the pay that actresses command, in comparison with their male counterparts in the film industry. In 2016, she supported India's first transgender band, the 6-Pack Band (initiated by Y-Films), by providing a voice over in their first single, \"Hum Hain Happy.\" Sharma has also spoken up for animal rights on social media. In April 2014, she took to Twitter to ask for a ban on horse-drawn carriages in Mumbai. In June 2015, she condemned the Yulin Dog####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Meat Festival in China, and urged her fans to sign an online petition aimed at stopping it. In October 2015, she launched 'Pawsitivity', a campaign aimed at sensitising people about the adverse effects of noise, air, water and soil pollution on animals. In October 2017, Sharma launched her own clothing line, named Nush.</s><s>Media image. Priya Gupta of \"The Times of India\" has said that \"the best part of [Sharma's] stardom is that she does not have the trappings of a star.\" Kalpana Nair of \"Firstpost\" stated: \"actresses like Sharma command the respect they do in a largely conservative and male-dominated industry and the fact that their fan base grows when they take on roles that are not conventional is good reason for us to beam widely and walk with a spring in our step\". Samar Srivastava, writing for \"Forbes\", called her \"unafraid\", and added: \"you would be hard-pressed to associate Sharma with the stereotype of a mainstream leading lady.\" \"The Times of India\" published that \"..she never shies away from putting [her opinion] across.\" Sharma featured on Rediff.com's list of \"Bollywood's Best####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Actors\" for \"Band Baaja Baaraat\" (2010), and \"NH10\" (2015).

She signed with LOEN Entertainment (now Kakao Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her first extended play (EP) \"Lost and Found\" (2008). Although her follow-up albums, \"Growing Up\" and \"IU...IM\", brought mainstream success, it was only after the release of \"Good Day\" (), the lead single from her 2010 album \"Real\", that she achieved national stardom. \"Good Day\" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019, it was ranked number one on \"Billboard\"s \"100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s\" list. With the success of her 2011 albums, \"Real+\" and \"Last Fantasy\", IU established herself as a formidable force on the music charts of her native country and further cemented her girl next door image as Korea's \"little sister\". 2011 also saw her first foray into songwriting with \"Hold My Hand\", which was written for####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the television series \"The Greatest Love\". IU's third studio album, \"Modern Times\" (2013), showcased a more mature musical style that marked a departure from her earlier girlish image, with several tracks reaching the top 10 on the Gaon Digital Chart. The album was ranked number two on \"Billboard\"'s \"25 Greatest K-Pop Albums of the 2010s\" list. IU subsequently exerted more creative control over her music; \"Chat-Shire\" marked the first time she was credited as the sole lyricist of her own album. IU's fourth studio album, \"Palette\" (2017), became her first to reach number one on \"Billboard\"'s World Albums chart.

Aside from her music career, IU has ventured into acting and hosting radio and television shows.

At an early age, IU showed interest in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry and began attending acting classes. Following her elementary school years, her family's financial situation deteriorated, and they eventually moved to the nearby Uijeongbu, in Gyeonggi Province####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####. She and her younger brother lived apart from their parents in a studio room with their grandmother and cousin for over one year in conditions of great poverty. IU had little contact with her parents over this period of time, but felt reassured under her grandmother's care. During her middle school years, IU found her passion for singing and decided to become a singer after being applauded for a performance she gave at her school's sports competition. She attended 20 auditions but failed to succeed in any of them, and was also scammed by fake entertainment companies. She later trained at Good Entertainment with Uee, Yubin, Heo Ga-yoon, and Jun Hyo-seong. After signing with LOEN Entertainment in 2007, she moved to Bangbae, Seoul. Due to her poor living conditions at the time, IU stated that she \"loved being at the studio\", where she could eat as much as she wanted and had a place to sleep. Her burgeoning career led to her decreased attendance at school and declining grades, with the exception of Korean literature. After graduating from in 2012, IU decided not to pursue post-secondary education in tandem with her singing career.</s><s>Career.</s><s>Career.:2008\u20132009: Career beginnings. After training####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### for ten months, IU made her debut in 2008 under her stage name, conceived by LOEN to mean \"I and You become one through music.\" She performed her debut single, \"Lost Child\" (), live for the first time on the music program \"M Countdown\" on September 18, 2008, making it her debut performance as a professional singer. IU recalled the crowd had hurled insults at her during the performance and initially felt discouraged by it, although she now considers it a beneficial experience. \"Lost Child\" is the lead single from her debut extended play (EP) \"Lost and Found\", which was released on September 24, 2008. For the album, IU was awarded the \"Rookie of the Month\" by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in November that same year. However, the album did not do well commercially. During an interview in 2011, IU said, \"My first album failed, but I'm grateful for that. If I had become successful as soon as I made my debut, I wouldn't appreciate my staff members and the popularity that I'm enjoying now.\" On April 23, 2009, IU launched her first studio album, \"Growing Up\", with the lead promotional single, \"Boo\". She began her album promotion the next day,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### performing \"Boo\" on KBS2's \"Music Bank\". The song was noted for its stark contrast in musical style to \"Lost Child\", which was described as a \"heavy\" and \"dark\" ballad compared to the 1980s \"retro sound\" of \"Boo\". Deemed as a \"strategic\" transformation, the dance choreography, stage costume and hairstyle shown in live performances were used to emphasize her youthfulness and project a \"cute\" image. Although it drew a favorable response from the public, IU, who was fifteen years old at the time, admitted that the image made her feel awkward. Several songs from \"Lost and Found\" were featured on her debut studio album \"Growing Up\", including \"You Know\" (); a new rock-style arrangement of the song was released as the follow-up single to \"Boo\". Towards the end of 2009, IU released her second EP, \"IU...IM\". She began promoting its lead single, \"Marshmallow\" (), on music programs from November 13, 2009. Recalling the performances, IU stated on a 2013 episode of \"Happy Together\" that she disliked having to wear the girlish costumes and hairstyle fashioned for the song promotions. The performances were well-received and were once again####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### labelled \"cute\", reminiscent of reviews for \"Boo\". As her popularity began to rise, IU made more frequent appearances on variety shows, performing on \"Star Golden Bell\", \"Kim Jung-eun's Chocolate\", and \"You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook\". Her acoustic covers of other artists' songs such as Girls' Generation's \"Gee\", Super Junior's \"Sorry, Sorry\", and Big Bang's \"Lies\" featured in these live performances gained tremendous interest online. In late 2009, she became a television presenter for the first time, hosting a weekly music chart show on Gom TV, while appearing as a fixed guest on multiple radio programs such as \"Kiss the Radio\", \"Volume Up\", MBC Standard FM's \"Starry Night\" and MBC FM4U's \"Best Friend Radio\".</s><s>Career.:2010\u20132011: Rising popularity and acting debut. On June 3, 2010, IU released \"Nagging\" (), a duet which she recorded with 2AM's Lim Seul-ong. The single debuted at twelve on the Gaon Digital Chart and shot up to the number-one position the following week, where it remained for three weeks.Gaon Digital Chart references for \"Nagging\": - -####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### - -  Written by Kim Eana and composed by Lee Min-soo, the pop ballad duet was used as one of the theme songs for the second season of the variety show \"We Got Married\". Soon after, IU released \"Because I'm a Woman\" (), one of the theme songs of MBC's historical drama, \"Road No. 1\". The song peaked at number six on the Gaon Digital Chart. IU's collaboration with Sung Si-kyung on \"It's You\" () for his album, \"The First\", debuted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. IU's third EP, \"Real\", was released on December 9, 2010. Produced by Jo Yeong-cheol and Choi Gap-won, \"Real\" debuted at number four on the Gaon Album Chart. The lead single, \"Good Day\" (), reunited IU with lyricist Kim Eana and composer Lee Min-soo after \"Nagging\", whom she would work with again on the lead singles of her next two studio albums. The uptempo song, as explained by Kim Eana, is about \"a shy girl who is nervous about expressing her feelings to the boy she likes.\" During the album's promotional period, IU also topped####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### the charts on the music programs \"M Countdown\", \"Music Bank\", and \"Inkigayo\". Both Kim Eana and Lee Min-soo considered the main factors of the song's success to be the use of the word \"oppa\" () in the chorus, as well as the three high-pitched notes that IU sings in semitone increments during the climax of the song. In addition to receiving praise for her vocal abilities, IU's fan base also expanded to a more varied demographic as compared to other K-pop groups. \"Billboard\" magazine ranked \"Good Day\" at number one on their list \"100 Greatest K-pop Songs of the 2010s\". To maintain public visibility, IU joined the cast of the variety show \"Heroes\", which aired from July 18, 2010, to May 1, 2011. Speaking fondly of the show, IU recalled the camaraderie she built with the other regular cast members despite the hectic two-day shooting schedules which only allowed them two-three hours of sleep. Shortly after joining \"Heroes\", IU was cast in teen drama \"Dream High\". Filming ran from December 2010 to February 2011, during which time she remained committed to \"Heroes\" and her existing promotions for \"####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####Good Day\". In her first acting role, IU played Kim Pil-sook, a shy and overweight school girl who dreams of becoming a professional singer. Admitting that she was doubtful about her readiness to take on acting, IU remarked that she gained confidence in learning that the part would require singing and would later describe the experience as a tremendously enjoyable one. For the series' soundtrack, she released the single, \"Someday\", which achieved number-one position on the Gaon Digital Chart on the week of January 30 \u2013 February 5, 2011. By the end of 2011, the single had sold 2,209,924 digital copies and is one of IU's best-selling singles for a soundtrack. A follow-up extended play to \"Real\" was released on February 16, 2011, with the title, \"Real+\", containing three songs. The lead single, \"Only I Didn't Know\" (), was composed by singer-songwriter Yoon Sang with lyrics written by Kim Eana. Yoon Sang wrote the song for IU after spotting her momentary sad expression on a television broadcast. The ballad's tone was a departure from her more recent releases, with IU describing it as dark, sad and sentimental, which is closer to her music preference.####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### The song performed well commercially, debuting at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. IU took on various side-projects after the end of \"Dream High\". On March 10, 2011, IU performed as the opening act for British singer-songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae's first solo concert in Seoul with two songs, before joining Bailey Rae during her performance of \"Put Your Records On\". Bailey Rae, whom IU described as her role model, said of IU, \"It's incredible that her voice is so soulful even though she's young.\" In the same month, IU was appointed as one of the new hosts of the music program, \"Inkigayo\", a position which she held until July 2013. In May 2011, IU recorded her first self-composed song, \"Hold My Hand\" (), for the romantic-comedy television series, \"The Greatest Love\". The song peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and sold 2,031,787 digital copies in 2011.

During this time, she also participated in \"\" but####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### eventually withdrew after recording one episode due to her overwhelming schedule. On her wide-ranging activities in entertainment, IU remarked that while singing, acting, and variety are all difficult, she finds variety to be the most tiring. IU's second studio album, \"Last Fantasy\", was released on November 29, 2011. The \"Korea JoongAng Daily\" described the album as one that would \"suit all kinds of musical tastes and fans\", while \"Billboard\" noted the \"cinematic feel\" of the album as set by the opening track, \"Secret\".

The album was well received by \"The Korea Times\" for providing \"a pleasant, calming respite from the mainstream music of today's times\", and praised IU for her reinterpretations: \"For every track, IU keeps a careful balance between preserving the song's original sentiments and altering the original with her own color and arrangements.\" \"Billboard\" highlighted the track, \"Pierrot Smiles at Us\" (), as the \"most ambitious tune she tackled\" and one that proved her diversity as a singer. IU's wish to conduct a more intimate and smaller scale concert was fulfilled in her third solo Korean####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### concert series, \"Just One Step... That Much More\".

In 2015, two years after her last acting role, IU starred alongside Kim Soo-hyun, Cha Tae-hyun, and Gong Hyo-jin in \"The Producers\", which was named as one of the most anticipated TV series of the year in South Korea. She played Cindy, a diva-like singer who decides to participate in a variety show to improve her public image. Analysing her character's perceived icy demeanor, IU commented that she could relate to her character's \"biting####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### attitude\" and how similar her character was to herself. The series and IU's portrayal of Cindy were met with lukewarm reviews at the premier but both the viewership and critical response improved over the course of the series, peaking at 17.7% viewership for the last episode. She performed two songs in character, \"Twenty Three\" and \"Heart\" (), both of which were later included as bonus tracks on her 2015 album, \"Chat-Shire\". While she wrote the lyrics for both songs, she also composed the music for \"Heart\", which was released as a digital single on May 18. \"Heart\" topped the charts upon its release and went on to become the tenth best-selling digital single of 2015 in South Korea. \"Heart\" was among a slew of K-pop songs used by South Korea's Defense Ministry in its propaganda broadcasts to North Korea during the two countries' tense standoff in August 2015, with the aim of advertising the \"South Korean youth culture\".

The lead single, \"Twenty####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-Three\" (), topped the national music charts upon release with several of the album's tracks also ranking in the top ten.

Despite positive critical reviews and success in the music charts, the album became controversial due to the lyrics of \"Zez\u00e9\" and the audio samples used in the bonus track \"Twenty Three\" (not to be confused with the similarly titled lead single). On November 4, the Korean publisher of the novel \"My Sweet Orange Tree\", from which IU drew inspiration for the song \"Zez\u00e9\", stirred debate in the entertainment industry on freedom of interpretation when it leveled criticisms at IU for her interpretation of the five-year-old protagonist as a \"sexual object\".

He was Deputy Prime Minister in the Howard Government from 1996 to 1999. Fischer was born in Lockhart, New South Wales. He served with the Australian Army in the Vietnam War. On his return he bought a farming property at Boree Creek. He served in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1971 to 1984. Fischer was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1984 election, representing the Division of Farrer until his retirement in 2001. He replaced Charles Blunt as leader of the National Party in 1990, and in the Howard Government served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. After leaving politics, Fischer served as chairman of Tourism Australia from 2004 to 2007, and was later Ambassador to the Holy See from 2009 to 2012.</s><s>Early life. Fischer was born on 3 May 1946 in Lockhart, New South Wales. He was the fourth of five children born to Barbara Mary () and Julius Ralph Fischer; he was predeceased by an older brother who died of meningitis as an infant. His parents were \"from once wealthy Melbourne families whose businesses had collapsed with the onset of the Great####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Depression\". Fischer's father worked as a jackaroo, settling in Boree Creek, New South Wales, in 1936, where he ran a stock and station agency and later bought a small farm. His paternal grandfather was born in Kleve, Germany, and had his assets frozen due to anti-German sentiment during World War I. His paternal grandmother was the daughter of a French seaman. Fischer's mother worked as a nurse prior to her marriage. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch immigrant who married the daughter of Francis Mason, an Irish immigrant who became speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. Fischer grew up on the family property at Boree Creek and attended Boree Creek Public School for six years. From 1958 he boarded at Xavier College in Melbourne. He graduated in 1963 and won a scholarship to attend university, but returned to Boree Creek to assist his family. In 1966 he was conscripted into the Australian Army and commissioned at the Officer Training Unit, Scheyville. Fischer served with the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR) between July 1966 and March 1969 as a second lieutenant. With his battalion, he served in the Vietnam War. Fischer was wounded in the Battle of Coral-Balmoral in May\u2013June 1968. 1RAR and the 1####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####st Australian Task Force were awarded Unit Citation for Gallantry for their actions Battle of Coral-Balmoral and Fischer was entitled to wear the citation insignia. Upon his return from Vietnam, Fischer took over the family property at Boree Creek and became active in the Country Party, as the party was then called.</s><s>Career.</s><s>Career.:State politics. Fischer represented Sturt in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1971 to 1980 and Murray from 1980 to 1984. He served on the opposition frontbench from 1978 to 1984.</s><s>Career.:Federal politics. In 1984, Fischer won the federal seat of Farrer in the New South Wales far west for the National Party of Australia (NPA), as the Country Party had been renamed. Within a year he was on the opposition frontbench, and soon became a popular figure in both the party and parliament. His sometimes rustic manner and bumbling English concealed a shrewd political brain. In 1990, when an attempt by Charles Blunt to modernise the Nationals' image ended with him losing his own seat, Fischer succeeded him as leader, defeating the former leader Ian Sinclair. Fischer was an enthusiastic supporter of the \"Fightback\" package of economic and tax reforms proposed by the Liberal leader John Hewson####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in 1991. But he was unsuccessful in persuading the majority of rural voters, particularly in Queensland, that the proposed changes, particularly the goods and services tax (GST), were in their interests, and Labor under Paul Keating won the 1993 election. On 23 March 1993, ten days after the election, Ian Sinclair unsuccessfully challenged Fischer for the leadership. In January 1994, Fischer suffered head and neck injuries in a car accident south of his property in Lockhart, New South Wales. His car T-boned a vehicle that had failed to yield to a give-way sign; the driver and passenger in the other vehicle were killed. Fischer was knocked unconscious in the accident and taken to hospital in Wagga Wagga. He took a month off from politics to aid his recovery, with his deputy John Anderson acting as party leader in his absence. The Liberals finally regained office under John Howard in 1996. Fischer became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. The Liberals had won a majority in their own right in the 1996 election, leaving the Nationals in a much weaker position compared to previous Coalition governments. Nonetheless, Fischer was fairly active. He supported the government introducing tough gun control measures on automatic and semi-automatic weapons following the Port Arthur massacre in April 1996 alongside then-prime minister####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### John Howard, measures which were opposed by much of his party's rural base. Fischer also had difficulty with the determination of many Liberals, including the Treasurer, Peter Costello, to carry out sweeping free-market reforms, including abolishing tariff protection for rural industries, deregulating petrol prices and implementing other measures which farmers' organisations regarded as harmful to themselves. In pushing to permanently extinguish native title rights of indigenous Australians following the Mabo and Wik decisions, Fischer attracted much criticism. Further trouble for Fischer and the Nationals came with the rise of One Nation, a right-wing populist party led by Pauline Hanson, a disendorsed Liberal candidate who was nonetheless elected member for the Queensland seat of Oxley at the 1996 federal election. One Nation had its greatest appeal in country areas of New South Wales and Queensland\u2014the Nationals' traditional heartland. For much of 1997 and 1998, it looked as though One Nation might sweep the Nationals out of existence. In the 1998 election campaign, however, Fischer strongly counter-attacked One Nation, mainly on the grounds of their \"flat tax\" economic policies, and succeeded in holding the Nationals' losses to one Senate seat in Queensland. In 2001, shortly before the expiry of his last parliamentary term, Fischer made public his####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### support for an Australian republic in the future. As an MP, and later as leader of the Nationals, Fischer often had a rather hectic schedule of visits to various rural National branch meetings, and other relevant functions and gatherings. As a result, he earned the affectionate nickname of \"Two-Minute Tim\" \u2013 often he would arrive, speak to the gathering for a few minutes (i.e. the \"Two-Minutes\"), grab a quick bite to eat while chatting to some of the attendees, then have to head off to the next stop on his schedule. In 2014 it was revealed on the ABC program \"A Country Road\" that sometime before the 1998 federal election, Fischer, then National Party leader, had met with his deputy John Anderson and former minister John Sharp for a luncheon at which they were surprised to learn from each other that they all intended to retire at the forthcoming election. They agreed that it was not a good idea for all of them to retire at the same time, as it could give a negative image to the party which at the time was battling against perceptions that its future was uncertain. In the end, only Sharp retired, with Fischer and Anderson delaying their own retirements and successfully recontesting the election. In 1999, he surprised####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### his colleagues by resigning as party leader and as a minister, and by announcing that he would retire at the election due in 2001. His decision to quit politics was motivated partly by the demands of his family, in particular that his son Harrison has autism (Fischer himself claimed to have \"high functioning\" autism, though he was never professionally diagnosed). Fischer is the only person to have served the entirety of his ministerial career as Deputy Prime Minister.</s><s>Career.:Post-political career. After his retirement, he returned to farming at Boree Creek, and became involved in charity work, assisting organisations such as the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Fred Hollows Foundation and Autism New South Wales. Fischer served as chairman of Tourism Australia from 2004 until 2007. He was made a fellow (FTSE) of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) in 2000. He served as chairman and a patron of the Crawford Fund, an initiative of the ATSE supporting international agricultural research, from 2001 to 2006. He was vice-chair and chair of the Crop Trust (2013\u20132017) and a \"vigorous supporter\" of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. He served as national chairman of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. He####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### also served as founding Patron of Australia for UNHCR (2001-2006), an Australian charity that raises funds for the UN's refugee agency. Fischer was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in the 2005 Australia Day Honours' List in recognition of his contributions to Australian politics, trade liberalisation, rail transport development, support of humanitarian aid, and to fostering community acceptance of cultural differences. On 21 July 2008, Fischer was nominated by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as the first resident Australian Ambassador to the Holy See. Fischer worked closely with the Vatican on all aspects of the canonisation of Australia's first Roman Catholic saint, Mary MacKillop. He retired from the post on 20 January 2012. In August 2013, following the shooting death of Australian baseball player Christopher Lane in Oklahoma, Fischer called for a tourism boycott of the United States to protest the activities of the National Rifle Association and what he felt were overly lax American gun laws.</s><s>Personal life. In 1992, Fischer married Judy Brewer. They had two sons. Fischer was noted as a tireless advocate for rail transport and was probably Australia's best known railfan. He had a childhood hobby of studying rail gauges of the world. After retiring from politics he continued his association with rail as special envoy for the Adelaide####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to Darwin railway line and travelled on the first freight train and first \"Ghan\" passenger train to Darwin in 2004. The V class GT46C locomotive V544, owned and operated by Aurizon, is named after him. In 2007 he led the Rail Freight Network Review into rail freight in Victoria, as commissioned by the Victorian Government. Between 2008 and 2009, Fischer hosted three series of ABC Local Radio podcasts \"The Great Train Show\", covering a wide range of railway topics from around the world and within Australia. In October 2018, Fischer was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. He died on 22 August 2019 at the Albury-Wodonga Cancer Centre in East Albury, New South Wales at age 73. Fischer himself attributed the illness to exposure to Agent Orange during his service in Vietnam.

Ji Sung approached director Yoo Chul-yong, saying he wanted the role. \"All In\" was a big hit, and Ji Sung's popularity rose and became known as a Hallyu star.

In 2009, Ji Sung collaborated again with writer Choi Wan-kyu and director Yoo Chul-yong of \"All In\" in the revenge drama \"Swallow the Sun\", adapted from the novel by Kang Chul-hwa, and shot on location in Jeju Island, Las Vegas and South Africa.
